DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources are

- written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language with easy-to-learn,
  plain-text formatting syntax; and
- hosted on **GitHub**, a popular repository hosting service based on the
  open-source version control software called git.

To develop content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you should:

- use a text editor that supports Markdown. If you don't already use one, we
  recommend Atom.
- be familiar with our GitHub submission and editing workflow.

In this chapter, we'll help you:

- set up Atom as your text editor
- get a copy of DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can work on your
  contribution locally
- show you how to run DARIAH-Campus on your computer so that you can preview
  your contribution to see exactly what it would look like once it's published
  on DARIAH-Campus.

## Setting up Atom

If you don't already use a Markdown-enabled text editor but wish to create
content for DARIAH-CAMPUS, you may want to use Atom, a customizable,
cross-platform open-source text editor.

If you already use a Markdown-enabled editor, you should continue to do so.
We're providing the instructions how to set up Atom only for those who are new
to Markdown. You should stick to the tools you know (and hopefully like).

1. Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io).
2. Open Atom.
3. Go to Atom > Preferences (if you are on a Mac) or File > Settings (if you are
   on Windows). Then click on Install: ![](images/atom_settings.png)
4. Make sure the "Packages" tab next to the search field is selected. Then type
   "mdxjs" in the search field and wait for results to show up. You should see a
   package called language-mdxjs in the results. Click on install.

5. In the search field, type: "Markdown Preview Enhanced". Install
   markdown-preview-enhanced.
6. Once the install finishes, click on Settings:
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings.png)
7. Once you open the settings for Markdown Preview Enhanced, you should see
   something like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings2.png)
8. Click on the File Extension input field in Settings and type `, .mdx` after
   `.markdown` like this: ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings3.png)
9. Uncheck the check box next to "Break On Single New Line":
   ![](images/atom_markdown_preview_settings4.png) You don't need to hit save.
10. Finally, go back to "Install", search for and install "Toolbar Markdown
    Writer".
11. Atom will ask you if you want to install dependencies, click on "Yes":

You should now have a functioning environment in Atom for your work on new
DARIAH-CAMPUS learning resources.

## Setting up DARIAH-Campus locally

1. If you haven't used GitHub before, make sure you
   [sign up](https://github.com/join) for a free account before you proceed.
2. Make sure you're logged in on GitHub.com.
3. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your
   computer.
4. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer.
5. Authenticate your GitHub Desktop application with your GitHub credentials by
   following these
   [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github).
6. In your browser, go to
   [https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus)
   and click on "fork". ![](images/github_fork.png)
7. If you are a contributor to various organizational repositories, GitHub may
   ask you to select where you would like to fork dariah-campus. Make your
   choice. ![](images/github_fork_to_which_repo.png)
8. Once the forking finishes, you will be taken to your own personal fork of
   DARIAH-CAMPUS. To make sure you are in the fork, check out that your user
   name (or the name of the organizational repository youo selected in step 7
   above) is displayed in the upper left corner.
   ![](images/github_fork_check_your_name.png)
9. Click on "Clone or download", then select "Open in Desktop".
   ![](images/github_clone_and_open_in_desktop.png)
10. In GitHub Desktop, choose where you want to save the cloned DARIAH-CAMPUS
    fork on your computer. ![](images/github_desktop_saving_a_fork.png)
11. The first you do this, it may take a couple of minutes, but don't despair,
    things will be quicker after the initial clone. Once you finish cloning your
    fork, you should see something like this:
    ![](images/github_desktop_result_of_cloned_fork.png)
12. To get to the folder with DARIAH-CAMPUS on your computer, click on Open in
    Atom (or your preferred editor, if you already set it up).

# Previewing DARIAH-Campus locally

## Installing all necessary software

1. Open up Terminal (usually found in ‘Utilities’ on a Mac).
2. Go to `https://brew.sh/`
3. Select the ‘Install Homebrew’ link and paste it into Terminal
4. You will be prompted for a password in Terminal: enter your laptop password.
   The installation will begin.
5. Next, type: "`brew install node`" into Terminal and hit ‘return’
6. Then, you need to install ‘Yarn'. Type "`brew install yarn`" into Terminal,
   and hit ‘return’

## Setting up a local host version of DARIAH-Campus for preview

###Instructions for Mac-users

To enable DARIAH-Campus to run locally on your machine so that you can preview
any changes you make, you will need to install node packages. To do this:

1. Find the folder you want to connect to node.js in ‘Finder’ (this will likely
   be the ‘DARIAH-Campus’ folder that you use in Atom).
2. In Terminal, type "`cd`" to change direction (also note, be sure to add a
   space after ‘cd’)
3. Drag and drop the folder from Finder into Terminal **on the same line as “cd
   “**. This will automatically write the ‘breadcrumb’ to the folder in
   Terminal.
4. Then type "`pwd`" (path to working directory) in Terminal and hit ‘return’
   This will show the correct breadcrumb trail to the folder to make sure you
   have the right one.
5. Type "`yarn install`" into Terminal (remember to hit ‘enter’). Installation
   may take a while if you haven’t installed this before. There is a progress
   bar on the bottom of Terminal that shows you how far along you are.
6. Type "`yarn develop`" (enter). This is the command to use if you want to
   develop the whole site, with all the necessary options for links and
   markdown, etc. This may also take a little while.
7. You can now view dariah-campus in the browser using the link given to you in
   the terminal, which will look like this: ⠀ `http://localhost:8000/`
8. Copy the url given in Terminal into your browser, which will give you the
   DARIAH-Campus home page. Any saved edits you make to the DARIAH-Campus .mdx
   files in Atom will automatically be shown on your local version.

###Instructions for Windows users (Instructions kindly provided by Ksenia
Zaytseva, OEAW)

1. Download node from [node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/](node.js
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run node.js installer
3. Open 'command line' and check node version by typing: `node -v`
4. Download yarn from
   [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
5. Type `Run yarn installer` (enter)
6. Check yarn version: `yarn --version`
7. In GitHub desktop, make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of
   DARIAH-Campus. To do this, follow the instructions above to 'Fetch Origin'
   and 'Merge' it to your local branch
8. Once any changes from the DARIAH-Campus 'master' on GitHub has been merged to
   your local branch, navigate to inside the dariah-campus directory (where the
   file package.json is located) in your file manager.
9. Run: `npm install`
10. Run: `npm install -g nodemon` This will install all project dependencies
11. Run: `npm start` This will launch the app running on localhost.
12. Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

> **REMEMBER!!** Any changes you make in Atom will only show up on your local
> version, but will not make any changes to the actual live version of
> DARIAH-Campus. This is useful if you want to try out a few things before
> updating. However, it’s important to remember that if you WANT to make changes
> to the live version, you will need to ‘commit’ them, ‘push origin’ and then
> ‘create a pull request’ so that the DARIAH-Campus editors can approve the
> changes.
