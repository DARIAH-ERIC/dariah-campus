## What is DARIAH-Campus?

DARIAH-Campus is both a _discovery framework_ and a _hosting platform_ for
DARIAH and DARIAH-affiliated offerings in training and education.

The goal of DARIAH-Campus is to widen access to open, inclusive, high-quality
learning materials that aim to enhance creativity, skills, technology and
knowledge in the digitally-enabled arts and humanities.

DARIAH-Campus started as a pilot project exploring different ways of capturing
and consolidating DARIAH learning resources within the H2020-funded project
DESIR (DARIAH-ERIC Sustainability Refined).

The beta version of DARIAH-Campus was released on November 6th, 2019 at the
DESIR Event in Zagreb.

We're still working on finalising the documentation and have a couple more
features in the pipeline. If you have learning resources that you would like to
share on or create for DARIAH-Campus, feel free to get in touch with us to
discuss next steps.

## Contact Us
