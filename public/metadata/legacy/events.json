This can be anything from crowdsourcing or creating a digital educational resource, to inadvertently enabling easy access to newly digitized material for everyone – not just researchers. Historians need to be aware of the potential of the digital in the dissemination and collection of historical knowledge, as well as the vital role they play in providing a context for local histories. This conference aims to address this issues.\nFusing the sharing of memories and amateur history-writing online – where it can easily be disseminated – means that historians have started to be more aware of and open to the public's role in collecting memories and sources, building networks, and enabling cross-border, non-Eurocentric ways of writing history. The internationalization of access to sources and histories leads to academic and amateur historians gaining insights into regions that previously were inaccessible, yet infrastructures for citizen participation remain limited to only a few. In many ways, digital methods, practices, and public engagement put a spotlight on history's relationship with collective memory and how interactive practices, collaborations, and co-creation affect both the field and the public in general.\nIn the following talks, selected from the _6th Digital History in Sweden Conference_, the learner will gain new perspectives on the use of AI and citizen science in digitization and digital history projects. In addition, the learner will gain insight into the creation and care of digital archives applying postcolonial perspectives.\nThe conference was organized by the Division of History at the Department of Cultural Sciences, with support from the Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies and Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, Linnaeus University, Sweden.\nFurther information about the conference can be found on the [official website](https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/current/events/2024/conferences/6th-digital-history-in-sweden-conference-unboxing-digital-methods-practices-and-public-engagement/).","type":{"id":"event","name":"Event"},"licence":{"id":"ccby-4.0","name":"CCBY 4.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},"social":{"website":"https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/current/events/2024/conferences/6th-digital-history-in-sweden-conference-unboxing-digital-methods-practices-and-public-engagement/","email":"digitalhistory2024@lnu.se"},"uuid":"tG0zSLmiUiS_eNA82o3iv","shortTitle":"The 6th Digital History in Sweden Conference: Unboxing Digital Methods, Practices and Public Engagement","categories":[{"id":"events","name":"Events","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/70ce29c5df1850417eb8ce02a084ff4c.jpg","width":640,"height":507,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAeEAABBAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBBESBRMhcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRA//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AjzUlitWs8o8QTTXW9OunXvs0NeSfS3zOAM/UREDjEudY+29P/9k="},"description":"DARIAH conducts face-to-face training measures as well.

AI, Lay Expertise, and the Sourcing of Historical Data","speakers":["orrje-jacob"],"body":"While public engagement in historical research has a long history, in recent years digital technology and the open-culture movement have profoundly changed historians' ability to build on lay expertise. Emerging AI-based methods in turn enable us to draw on the work of even larger crowds obscured through black boxed technology. These developments could be considered the foundation of a public humanities, formed through mutually beneficial collaborations. However, such an idealistic conception risks hiding more problematic relationships of asymmetric reward structures and exploitation. In this lecture, Dr. Jacob Orrje critically reflects on the global fiscal and moral economies of public engagement in a digital history that increasingly relies on pre-existing datasets and models. How do we create mutually beneficial collaborations if we rely on data and technology that systematically obscure the work we rely on? And finally: what are the connections between crowd sourcing and our contemporary online gig economy?\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"KmRFjLPLRIc\" />\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"orrje-jacob\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>"},{"title":"Archival Whispers – Finding and Showing Black Women in Caribbean Digital Archives","speakers":["pålsson-ale","raapke-annika"],"body":"Historical discussions regarding early modern women of color, free and enslaved, have predominantly been framed around the \"silence of the archive\", highlighting how stories and voices of women of color have been hidden from archival sources. While documents concerning free and enslaved Black women are disproportionately harder to find than those of white administrators, they are not as rare as is often imagined. The question is rather, what does one do with documents concerning Black women, and how should they be considered? In this lecture, Dr. Ale Pålsson and Dr. Annika Raapke discuss the intersection between Michel-Rolph Trouillot's \"archival silencing\" and the information avalanche of digital archives.\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"Xtepiihscnw\" />\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"pålsson-ale\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n\n  <Speaker speaker=\"raapke-annika\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>"},{"body":"[Global Archives Online](https://calib.ro/global-archive) is a directory of open digital collections for the study of colonial and global history.

A powerful search function allows users to quickly identify relevant collections. Global Archives Online is maintained by the Linnaeus University Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies as a free service to the global community of researchers and students.\n\nLinked to the directory, the Global Archives Online Graduate School (GAO-S) is an interdisciplinary and international initiative organized by Stockholm University in collaboration with Linnaeus University and Lund University, along with PhD students from universities in Sweden and abroad. Offered in a hybrid format during the fall term of 2024, GAO-S focuses on two primary aims: the methodological development of digital archive work and the pedagogical enhancement of undergraduate supervision. The program seeks to foster a bottom-up dialogue between scholars and students both within and beyond Swedish research institutions. In this talk, two of the authors, Prof. Stefan Amirell and Simon Ottosson, present the GAO-S project and share key pedagogical insights gathered during the initial months of teaching.\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"zLRI3VMEJaE\" caption=\"Part 1: Global Archives Online and GAO-S\" startTime=\"1\" />\n\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"KVXRTeV1bQY\" caption=\"Part 2: Global Archives Online and GAO-S\" />\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"amirell-stefan\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n\n  <Speaker speaker=\"ottosson-simon\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n\n  <Speaker speaker=\"tremml-werner-birgit\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n\n  <Speaker speaker=\"poggio-eleonora\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>","title":"Global Archives Online and GAO-S: Key Takeaways from Building and Teaching History with Digital Archives","speakers":["amirell-stefan","ottosson-simon","tremml-werner-birgit","poggio-eleonora"]},{"title":"Digitizing migrated colonial archives: infrastructures and connections","speakers":["marcussen-eleonor"],"body":"A lot has been said about cultural theories as well as debates in archival science regarding the digitization of colonial archives.  The collection \"Joseph Stephens' time in India\" (1860-1869) in the Joseph Stephens Archive is a collection of papers which migrated with Stephens from Bombay to the Huseby estate in southern Sweden at the end of the 1860s. The collection contains rare sources about contractors and sub-contractors, the relations between them, and their relation to the colonial state and the informal labour force's composition and work conditions during an intensive period of infrastructural expansion in India. In this paper, Dr Eleonor Marcussen begins by charting the history of the collection in order to contextualize the arguments for preservation and access which has resulted in its digitization. She then points to the possibilities and limitations of using digitized migrated archives by discussing how connections and infrastructure can enable access and shed light on the limits of the official colonial archives.\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"vQgyi087jeQ\" />\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"marcussen-eleonor\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>"}],"partners":[]},{"id":"digging-for-gold-knowledge-extraction-from-text","kind":"events","title":"Digging for Gold - Knowledge Extraction from Text","shortTitle":"Digging for Gold - Knowledge Extraction from Text","eventType":"Summer School","lang":"en","date":"2024-02-06T13:28:57.352Z","tags":[{"id":"editing-tools","name":"Editing tools","description":"Editing tools help a researcher to manage, edit and visualise digital data"},{"id":"data-visualisation","name":"Data visualisation","description":"Data visualisation looks at the different technologies and tools that a researcher can use to visualise their data and enhance the communication of their findings"},{"id":"scholarly-publishing","name":"Scholarly publishing","description":"Scholarly publishing relates to issues and best practice for (digital) publication of scholarly outputs"}],"featuredImage":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/events/digging-for-gold-knowledge-extraction-from-text/images/89100efe9e853dc9beec97e253bceac4.jpg","width":4032,"height":3024},"categories":[{"id":"events","name":"Events","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/70ce29c5df1850417eb8ce02a084ff4c.jpg","width":640,"height":507,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAeEAABBAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBBESBRMhcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRA//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AjzUlitWs8o8QTTXW9OunXvs0NeSfS3zOAM/UREDjEudY+29P/9k="},"description":"DARIAH conducts face-to-face training measures as well.

Digital communication in the field of art, in addition to everyday, professional and administrative communication, which also includes promotional activities, encompasses shaping and presenting artistic work with the help of digital technologies and, afterward, digital processing and storage of administrative and archival material.\n\nPerforming arts, which are considered intangible cultural heritage, are particularly difficult to adapt to this situation precisely because their value is largely manifested as the totality of all tangible elements (scenography, costume design, dramatic text, lighting, etc.), which at a specific moment in conjunction with the audience create a unique and intangible experience and expression. Extensive use of digital technology and communication platforms for theatrical performance implies a radical change in the communication code and requires a major adaptation of previously acquired and established knowledge. It also requires the acquisition of new knowledge, which is often not closely related to the arts and humanities.\n\nThe conference aimed to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary connecting information sciences and computer science with the performing arts in the context of digital humanities while reflecting on the achievements so far on this path. Therefore, through three thematic blocks it was shown, among other things, how digital humanities tools can serve scholars in performing arts research, what is the relationship between digital technologies and theatrical performance and, finally, what are the possibilities of digital archiving and linking data on performing arts material on both national and international level. At the same time, the conference introduced members of the national theatre community, i.e. performing arts and theatre (i.e. performance) studies with leading international scholars and experts in the field.\n\n**Learning outcomes**\n\nBy following this event resource, you should be able to:\n\n- gain insight into how using digital tools in performance can transform the experience of theatre\n- understand the basic challenges of developing online archive resources for performing arts\n- understand how digital theatre studies can cross methods with cognitive science\n\n**Keynote speakers**\n\n- Cécile Chantraine Braillon: Digital Theatre Studies: Crossing Perspective and Methods with Cognitive Science\n- Andrii Palatnyi: Offline vs/ & Online: Digital Theatre in COVID and War\n\n**Organizers**\n\nDARIAH-EU Working Group Theatralia; Croatian Association of Theatre Critics and Theatre Scholars (Zagreb, Croatia), Croatian ITI Centre – International Theatre Institute (Zagreb, Croatia), The Division for the History of Croatian Theatre of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Zagreb, Croatia), The Institute of Ethnology and Folklore Research (Zagreb, Croatia)\n\n**Partners**\n\nEmpiria Theatre (Zagreb, Croatia), Gogolfest (Kyiv, Ukraine), Youth Culture Centre “Ribnjak“ (Zagreb, Croatia), La Rochelle University (La Rochelle, France), Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek (Osijek, Croatia)","type":{"id":"event","name":"Event"},"licence":{"id":"ccby-4.0","name":"CCBY 4.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},"synthesis":"https://dariah.hr/arhiva/Performing-Arts--Transitioning-to-the-Digital-Age--Book-of-Abstracts.pdf","uuid":"3LWI-AKBI2z6duyLjHQHu","sessions":[{"title":"Workshop: When Theatre Meets Zoom + The \"e-spect@tor\" Experience","speakers":["chantraine-braillon-cécile","srnec-hamer-iva","palatnyi-andrii","žugić-borić-anamarija"],"body":"The workshop is aimed at performing artists, especially theatre actors and theatre audiences.

It is a big challenge and we have encountered many problems due to a wide time span which amounts to 27 years of the festival's existence. During this period archiving technology was constantly changing and what we have today is a lot of material in different formats the content of which has to be adjusted to new standards. From press cuttings in paper form to CDs and DVDs and old websites for each year's program which are not supported anymore (like with Adobe Flash Player), not to mention old video tapes with recorded performances.

In comparison to traditional musical forms, computer music allows previously unreachable levels of automation, control, interaction, and sonic diversity. Techniques like algorithmic composition (using formal rules to create music), data sonification (translating data into sound), live coding (writing computer code that generates music live in front of the audience), automation in multimediality, and various aspects of interactivity open novel opportunities in the context of theatre.

Using the Digitized Archive of the National Theatre of Greece as the reference archive, I tried enriching it through its semantic interconnections with digital sources that provide relevant knowledge. Some of the most notable existing theatre archives and databases have been researched as well as the users' informative demands influenced by the types of information that appear in each archive, such as biographies, productions, texts, and interviews. This talk introduces a conceptual model designed to be as adequate as possible to represent theatrical archives and to cover a sufficient range of offered theatrical information.

As a result, information about 7,500 performers, designers, organizations and venues has been transformed from unstructured text into linked open data. This open data was then made available for reuse via an open knowledge graph called Artsdata and via Wikidata, an open knowledge base associated with the Wikimedia movement. This data-centric work has laid a foundation of data for reuse across performing arts archives and other performing arts applications.

Reliance on recollection and bodily tools such as observation, memorization, and evocation in the reconstruction of events are just as reliable or just as unreliable as reliance on archived material remains, because the material remains do not tell about what was excluded from the archive and why it was excluded, and are always in the service of construction, which implies an interpretation, a narrative, and not reconstruction of real events.\n\n<Video provider=\"youtube\" id=\"zNgj2vYugGg\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"slunjski-ivana\">\n\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>"},{"title":"Processes & Practices: Understanding Dance Researchers and Dance Archivists to Develop Future Online Dance Archive Resources","speakers":["johnstone-bethany"],"body":"The talk provides an introductory exploration of current PhD research being conducted into the information-seeking behaviours of dance researchers as well as the practice of dance archivists, to inform any future developments of online dance archives resources.

It was directed by Kate Foley, with visual effects and editing by Damjan Šporčić. It was filmed with 110 young dancers, six adults and eight choreographers during the pandemic in 2021. The original score by Zoran Majstorović features the musical traditions and instruments of the contemporary migrant trail from Mesopotamia to Northern Europe. The Journey of Halima is based on the children's book of the same name by Nikos Kalaitzidis with Michalis Darnakis, Maria Laftsidou, and Andreas Mavridis, written to empower refugee children. This hybrid form of dance documentation marked a triumph over a difficult period of compromise in which dance education suffered from poor digital tools and inadequate space, 19 where Viber and Microsoft Teams clashed with poor reception in cramped hallways, bedrooms and kitchens.

We present how Europeana and its partners work to address these issues, in a collaborative and flexible fashion. The Europeana Data Model paves the way for gathering richer metadata, but all parties need to exploit this potential. Especially, populating the data model's elements with multilingual linked open data vocabularies can bring a lot of value. We encourage our partners to publish richer metadata that exploits the controlled vocabularies they often already use. We also perform automatic metadata enrichment, using a purpose-built linked-data based \"entity collection\" as target. Finally, partners have also embarked on producing their own automatic metadata enrichments.

This presentation primarily concerns the subject integration work which involved 59 local vocabularies containing over 19,000 subject terms in 16 different languages. A vocabulary matching tool allowed each data provider to define correctly formatted mappings from their own local vocabularies to a central common 'spine' vocabulary (Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus, AAT). Using the resultant mappings, the metadata records were enriched with AAT identifiers.

These include long-term digital archives as well as research project overview websites and training platforms. Vocabularies allow depositors and users to describe resources by indicating their most relevant aspects, usually summarised in single keywords. Analysing vocabularies is therefore a productive way of discovering which aspects of a research area are covered by a particular service, and how services relate to each other. This hands-on session presents a practical workflow for comparing vocabularies from different services and identifying possible overlaps. 'Vocabularies' is used here in a broad sense, including both controlled vocabularies (ranging from controlled lists to thesauri) and folksonomies, i.e. collections of uncontrolled keywords used in a service. A Jupyter notebook is included, containing the Python code needed to perform the comparison. A set of vocabularies are already provided for comparison (such as the SSH Open Marketplace keywords and Getty AAT). In addition, an accompanying presentation illustrates some preliminary thoughts on vocabulary terminology, usage and interoperability (with a special focus on the users' perspective) as well as the description of a comparison between vocabularies of the Austrian DH community recently performed at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage.\n\nLink to the Jupyter notebook: https://zenodo.org/record/7845914#.ZEEG5HbP0Uo\n\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"rastinger-nina-c\">\n  </Speaker>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"carloni-massimiliano\">\n  </Speaker>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"ďurčo-matej\">\n  </Speaker>\n</Speakers>","synthesis":"https://zenodo.org/record/7849428#.ZEFEAHbP3vU"}]},{"id":"building-and-linking-humanities-digital-spatial-infrastructures-for-research-in-the-nordic-countries","kind":"events","title":"Building and Linking Humanities' Digital Spatial Infrastructures","shortTitle":"Building and Linking Humanities' Digital Spatial Infrastructures","eventType":"Workshop","lang":"en","date":"2023-02-16T07:21:18.701Z","tags":[{"id":"controlled-vocabularies","name":"Controlled Vocabularies","description":"Controlled Vocabularies are organised structures for words or phrases that allow for machine readability and easy retrieval"},{"id":"data-management","name":"Data management","description":"Data Management is a set of practices and techniques used by researchers to ensure that their data is organised, structured and easily reusable for future research"},{"id":"data-modeling","name":"Data modeling","description":"Data modeling refers to the process of creating a machine-readable conceptual representation of objects"},{"id":"data-visualisation","name":"Data visualisation","description":"Data visualisation looks at the different technologies and tools that a researcher can use to visualise their data and enhance the communication of their findings"},{"id":"dh","name":"DH","description":"Digital Humanities (DH) is a scholarly discipline that deals with the use of computational methods in the study of the humanities"},{"id":"spatial-humanities","name":"Spatial humanities","description":"Spatial Humanities is research that combines humanities, environmental sciences and geography-based practices to study physical, cognitive, perceptual and relational aspects of the human spatial experience"},{"id":"research-infrastructures","name":"Research infrastructures","description":"Research Infrastructures are (virtual) meeting points for researchers in a broad disciplinary field to share, collaborate, network, develop and contribute solutions to the research needs of researchers in their community"}],"categories":[{"id":"events","name":"Events","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/70ce29c5df1850417eb8ce02a084ff4c.jpg","width":640,"height":507,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAeEAABBAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBBESBRMhcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRA//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AjzUlitWs8o8QTTXW9OunXvs0NeSfS3zOAM/UREDjEudY+29P/9k="},"description":"DARIAH conducts face-to-face training measures as well.

But the complexity of the entanglement of historical actors, places, institutions or temporal sequences makes finer modeling necessary if we want to go beyond a simplistic \"datafication\".\n\nTo encourage curiosity towards other modes of analysis and put the data modeling (and therefore the historical sources) at the center of the research process, this article attempts to discuss what makes a historical network, its components, its relationships, its layers and its different facets.

Connecting these repositories, the W3C’s Web Annotation specification builds upon Linked Data principles for targeting any web resource or Linked Data entity with syntactic and semantic annotation. However, today’s platform-centric infrastructure diminishes the distinction between institutional and individuals’ data. This poses issues of digital ownership, interoperability, and privacy of data stored on centralized services. With Hyperwell, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel architecture that offers real-time, distributed synchronization of Web Annotations, leveraging contemporary Peer-to-Peer technology. Extending the Peer-to-Peer network, institutions provide Hyperwell gateways that bridge peers’ annotations into the common web. These gateways affirm a researcher’s affiliation while acting as a mere mirror of researchers’ data and maintaining digital ownership.\n\n<Link href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/3750243#.XpV3PC9PjOQ\" label=\"Get full paper on Zenodo\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"kaßel-jan\">\n\nJan Kaßel is pursuing his Master’s degree in Computer Science at Leipzig University, Germany.

The session dwelled on emerging as well as core research themes and directions for KDL, such as immersive experiences, software development, archiving and sustainability, machine learning and big data analysis, design, visualisation and indigenous DH. The last part of the session focused on the contexts in which KDL operates that necessitate a balance between a drive for innovation and focus on continuity and value, between experimentation and institutional responsibility. In order to address the scale and complexity of contemporary DH projects and infrastructures, KDL has adopted and adapted industry standards, broadly accepted research data management workflows and clearly defined processes for documentation and software development lifecycle (SDLC).\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/1.1-Intro_KDL.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"smithies-james\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"King's Digital Lab: Overview and Context","speakers":["smithies-james"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThe first part of the session began with the description of team roles at KDL, aligned with a holistic vision of Research Software Engineering (RSE) career paths plotted in a continuum from research active to research support profiles, mappable to best practices in industry standards such as development and management frameworks (in particular the Agile Dynamic Systems Development Method: DSDM) and competence skills (e.g. SFIA). These roles and promotion processes were compared and contrasted with traditional roles and promotion processes in academia on the one hand, and industry on the other. Focusing on the example of the analyst role, the range of tasks and responsibilities inherent to the role was demonstrated.\n\nIn what followed, infrastructures and frameworks used at KDL, the lifecycle of a typical project and its SDLC were outlined, beginning with initial contact by the partner (i.e. an academic, a research institution or a business) through to funding application, release and post-project hosting and maintenance. Sources of funding and classification of projects according to size were also discussed.\n\nKDL members of staff work on several projects in different stages of development at the same time, and in order to manage the workflow most effectively, the team has implemented flexible “timebox planning”, whereby tasks are planned for each “timebox” (two-week period) and then are revised according to priority and resources. In order to manage and document the processes effectively, KDL has developed a set of templates for project governance documentation corresponding to each stage of the project SDLC (such as “Terms of Reference”, “Feasibility”, “Product Quote”, “Project Review Record” and “Service Level Agreement (SLA))”. Simplified templates with contextual information on use can be consulted by accessing KDL’s repository on GitHub.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/1.2-Practices_1.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"KDL Practices: Team, Systems, Data and Models (Part One)","speakers":["ciula-arianna"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThe second part of the session introduced the concept of “Double Diamond” – a visual map of the design process (developed and described by the [Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond)). The Double Diamond model posits the necessity, for any creative process, to spend time defining the problem before setting out to solve it. Therefore, the process is divided into four distinct phases – Discover (a problem), Define (the problem), Develop (a solution) and Deliver (the solution).\n\nThese four phases can be mapped onto two of the three stages of KDL’s workflow which comprises\n\n1. Pre-project (Discover/Define)\n2. Project development from start to launch (Define, Design and Develop)\n3. Post project (maintenance, archiving and decommission)\n\nThe second phase of project evolutionary development is an iterative cycle that evolves as development progresses.\n\nThe rest of the session was dedicated to detailed analysis of workflows by RSE role (Project Manager; Analyst; Software Engineer; UI/UX Designer; Systems Manager) with the tasks mapped onto the three stages of KDL project workflow, from Pre-project through Project development to Post-project.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/1.3-Practices_2.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\">\n\n</Speaker>\n</Speakers>\n","title":"KDL Practices: Team, Systems, Data and Models (Part Two)","speakers":["ciula-arianna"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nAt the beginning of the session, the elements to be taken into consideration while planning any DH project were named and discussed: a **core** idea typically evolves into a set of **research** questions, then **methods** to address them are identified along with **management** approaches, required **budget** to support the project and any **sustainability** issues that need to be planned for in advance.\n\nWhen it comes to development, in contrast to traditional project management approaches that fix the features to be implemented in the course of the project, Agile project management approaches, adopted by KDL, treat time and cost as fixed variables. Instead of committing to implementing a set of features, the team commits to delivering value within defined constraints of cost and time, whereas features may change as the project progresses.\n\nAt pre-project stage, feasibility analysis needs to be conducted before a project is considered viable and the rest of the life-cycle initiated. In order to prioritise requirements, KDL uses a prioritisation technique known as the MoSCoW principles, whereby, following consultation with the partners, each required feature is assigned a status: M for “must”, S for “should”, C for “could” and W for “will not have this time”. W requirements, although recorded by the analyst, are considered to be outside the scope of the project, and C requirements are low priority. In the iterative process of project development, this prioritisation technique is used throughout the project at review meetings.\n\nSince this training workshop was part of a specific project (\"MaDiH: Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan\") with a defined core idea and a set of high level requirements, the rest of the session focused on the project deliverables. Producing a Proof of Concept (PoC) is one of the objectives of the project; the notion of prototype, proving that a scaled-up version of the project can be executed, was therefore discussed and critiqued as RSE best practice to encourage review of and reflection on the project’s feasibility and gap analysis.\n\nThe session further provided some examples taken from the MaDiH pre-project stage and demonstrated KDL’s template for requirement analysis.\n\nIn addition, the applications of the “Comprehensive Archive Network” (CKAN) system, widely used across the public sector, as a proposed solution for capturing metadata in MaDiH was discussed as an example of how an RSE solution evolves through the KDL software development lifecycle.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/2.1-Requirements.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\"></Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","speakers":["ciula-arianna"],"title":"Project Requirements"},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThis session started with a discussion of the concepts of Data, Information and Knowledge. A data model, i.e. a _formalised description of how to organize data in an information system_, is the backbone of most RSE evolving solutions. One way of modelling data is by creating an ontology, that is an explicit set of relational statements connecting entities (e.g. artefacts, places, people, events). Ontologies not only help organise data for the purposes of a particular project, they also make future integration and reuse of structured data possible.\n\nThe session traced the meaning of the term “ontology” from philosophy to data modelling, where it is used to designate conceptualisation and agreed upon representation of data about a knowledge domain.\n\nThere are two approaches to building ontologies. One can be described as realist (that strives to render full complexity), the other as pragmatic (that focuses on representation of data best suited for the project and purpose in question). Due to the often complex and ambiguous nature of data in the Humanities and Cultural Heritage sectors, DH scholars often favour the pragmatic approach. In order to understand the concept of ontology, metaphors such as “agreement”, “contract” or “compromise” were introduced as useful semantic devices in the data modelling process. Access to expert knowledge about the domain and reflection on the future uses of the data were discussed as essential constituent parts of this process.\n\nAfter analysing a set of examples from the “Henry III Fine Rolls” project, the session concluded with a detailed discussion of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) as a guide for good practice in conceptual modelling in the Humanities and Cultural Heritage.\n\nThe afternoon of Day Two was dedicated to a visit to the [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhrSG-Ymp5wIVWODtCh15GAg3EAAYASAAEgI91_D_BwE) led by Dominic Oldman and Diana Tanase.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/2.2-Data_Modelling.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Data Modelling","speakers":["ciula-arianna"]},{"body":"## Abstract: Requirement Analysis and Data Modelling for MaDiH\n\nDuring this project-specific session, the information presented in the first two days of the workshop was applied further to the concrete example of the Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan (MaDiH) project. The session discussed the requirement elicitation phase of the project, presented the template for requirements elicitations developed at KDL, the project’s CKAN instance and the workflow for the identification and entry of datasets and resources, with reference to supporting techniques, such as interview template and diary/log, and standard SDLC operational methods, such as the review process.\n\n## RSE in Action\n\nThe session was followed by two short presentations by partners showcasing other projects:\n\n1.

A useful way of thinking about 3D modelling consists in differentiating between “acquisition” (i.e. direct scanning or sensing of a physical surface) and “creation” (i.e. manual, interpretative (re)construction).\n\nThe second part of the session was dedicated to photogrammetry, a set of techniques and tools for extracting three-dimensional data from images. The necessary equipment and available software tools as well as the frictions between “ideal set-up” and the more realistic contexts of noisy environments for capturing images were discussed. Different stages of the photogrammetry process (of the “photogrammetry pipeline”) such as Natural Feature Extraction, Image Matching, Features Matching, Structure from Motion, Depth maps estimation, Meshing, and Texturing were outlined. Limitations of the method and ways of counteracting them were mentioned. The session concluded with a practical exercise, equipment demonstrations, and a taste of immersive experiences.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/3.2-Practical_Methods.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"jakeman-neil\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Practical Methods in Digital Heritage: 3D Modelling, Photogrammetry, XR","speakers":["jakeman-neil"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThis session covered a number of topics in best practices of design and development of Research Infrastructures with a particular focus on Research Data Management (RDM).\n\nIt started with an outline of the “Open Access Chain” (Open standards – Open data – Open source – Open licenses – Open access), drawing on opportunities and challenges that an open approach to data presents in an RSE context. One of the key challenges is a necessity for a rigorous SDLC (software development lifecycle) process and adoption of common standards.\n\nResponding to the needs of data-intensive research and machine-actionability, FORCE11 coalition developed FAIR data principles that specify a set of requirements for data and metadata: data should be _findabile_, _accessible_, _interoperable_ and _reusable_. To facilitate transition to FAIR data, Go-FAIR initiative developed a workflow (“FAIRification process”) that guides researchers from retrieval of non-FAIR data to deployment of FAIR data resources.\n\nIn the session, the place of RDM in the software development lifecycle at KDL was discussed. The nature of Agile projects that KDL often works with, however, means that in many cases the project begins before any data is collected or data collection continues throughout evolutionary development requiring monitoring methods and forward-planning to be in place and exercised throughout the SDLC.\n\nWith proliferation of data, questions of privacy are more and more pressing. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became directly applicable in all EU states on 25 May 2018 and requires informed consent to process personal data. In this context, the history of the regulation and its implications for DH projects, both legal and ethical, were discussed.\n\nThe final topic of the session was the challenges related to software sustainability and citation, including the tension between the need for openness and reusability and a requirement for appropriate citation giving credit to contributors to every stage of the project. In order to ensure adequate monitoring of the project at every stage of its development, issues of Versioning, Sharing, Documentation, Licensing, Publishing (e.g. via Zenodo) need to be addressed.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/4.1-Research_Infrastructures.pdf\" />\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"smithies-james\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Best Practices in Design and Development of Research Infrastructures","speakers":["ciula-arianna","smithies-james"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThe session focused on the concept of indigenous data sovereignty and its application to DH projects that deal with artefacts, data, images, and concepts that may be considered sacred, secret, or culturally sensitive by certain groups of people. Data sovereignty typically refers to the understanding that data is subject to the laws of the nation in which it is stored, whereas indigenous data sovereignty is a concept that reflects a conviction that data is subject to the laws of the nation from which it was collected (i.e. of the source community). These issues become most poignant when dealing with cultural artefacts from non-Western cultures (such as Māori culture) or looted objects dispersed in Western collections and the dissemination of information about them. The tensions between Open Access principles and the requirements of Intellectual Property Rights/Management were highlighted. The session warned against presenting data without context, commercialisation without permission, and the use of data to the detriment of communities and advocated respect for and a need for consultation with the communities. The session formulated a set of questions to be considered when envisaging any DH project that may deal with data that is potentially sensitive for a group or groups of people, stressing the requirement for well-thought-through infrastructures for holding datasets as well as for consistent policies for data management and access.\n\nThis session by Samantha Callaghan was presented by Dr James Smithies.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/4.2-Data_Sovereignty.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"callaghan-samantha\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"smithies-james\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Data Sovereignty","speakers":["callaghan-samantha","smithies-james"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\nThis final session of the workshop started with the presentation of UK and European DH infrastructures and organisations, a list of links to internationally recognised policies and best practices in DH, important peer-reviewed journals and mailing lists dedicated to diverse aspects of human and technical research infrastructures that may be of relevance to the MaDiH project and of interest to its members.\n\nThe second part of the session was dedicated to discussion and requirements elicitation for the MaDiH project.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/4.3-Community_Pointers.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"ciula-arianna\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"smithies-james\">\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Community Pointers","speakers":["ciula-arianna","smithies-james"]}]},{"id":"shaping-new-approaches-to-data-management-in-arts-and-humanities","kind":"events","title":"Shaping new approaches to data management in arts and humanities","eventType":"Winter School","lang":"en","date":"2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"id":"open-science","name":"Open science","description":"Open Science is the process or processes by which a scholar ensures that their research outputs, which might include data, publications and training activities, are available and open to all without restriction"},{"id":"open-access","name":"Open access","description":"Open Access is a mechanism enabling scholars to access content for use and reuse, usually in a digital format, for free"},{"id":"data-management","name":"Data management","description":"Data Management is a set of practices and techniques used by researchers to ensure that their data is organised, structured and easily reusable for future research"}],"categories":[{"id":"events","name":"Events","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/70ce29c5df1850417eb8ce02a084ff4c.jpg","width":640,"height":507,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/xAAeEAABBAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBBESBRMhcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRA//aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AjzUlitWs8o8QTTXW9OunXvs0NeSfS3zOAM/UREDjEudY+29P/9k="},"description":"DARIAH conducts face-to-face training measures as well.

In this workshop, participants will be encouraged to examine their own scholarly practices and those of others, refining our responses to the fundamental question: “what are Humanities research data?” After a warm-up session dedicated to epistemological reflections on the role of data within humanities research, the session introduces the participants to the basics in research data management, data services and the FAIR principles in a humanities context. The aim is to see how all these at first potentially abstract new concepts enable researchers to conduct more effective research if they are well-translated into community practices.\n\nClearly, the generic research data management guidelines do not always align well with the cultural, conceptual and epistemological complexity of research data in the arts and humanities and the many entailments of this complexity, such as:\n\n- Data in the humanities comes in a wide variety of source types, formats and corpus sizes. The word ‘data’ itself is hardly used and mostly replaced by the notion of primary sources;\n- Researchers can lack know-how as to how to deal with the various dimensions of data management: documentation, hosting, identification or re-use conditions are not part of the education curricula in the humanities;\n- A fundamental difference between the epistemic cultures of hard sciences and arts and humanities is that in the arts and humanities the wide range of scholarly information referred to as cultural heritage data are not autonomous products of research projects but are deeply embedded in the memory of the institutions (museums, libraries, archives) that preserve, curate and (co)produce them;\n- These institutions are not only data providers, as ownership of heritage data is inherently shared between them, the researcher communities, the public, and the people and cultures that give rise to the objects in question.\n- Access to and the digital availability of cultural heritage is the primary condition of research in the majority of humanities disciplines that defines the reusability and accessibility of scholarship built on them.\n\nDuring the session, we are going to address these challenges one by one in the context of responsible open data sharing practices. Participants are encouraged to discuss data management issues related to their own projects (or project ideas) ideas and to contact the trainers beforehand.\n\n<YouTube\n  id=\"Zqrkf7scGJA\"\n  caption=\"Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra - What is data in the humanities?\"\n/>\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/2.1 Toth-Czifra.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"tóth-czifra-erzsébet\">\n\nErzsébet started her job as Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU in March 2018. She studied comparative literature studies, cultural studies and linguistics at the University of Szeged (Hungary) as well as at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. She received her PhD in Cultural Linguistics summa cum laude in 2018 at Eötvös Loránd University for her corpus study of the evolution of certain Hungarian word-formation schemata. After graduating, she taught linguistics and Hungarian as foreign language at the Eötvös Loránd University as well as at the Fachhochschule Burgenland in Eisenstadt, Austria. In 2016, her commitment to democracy in science led her to join ScienceOpen, a research evaluation and discovery platform, as Content Integration Manager and open science advocate.

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that specifies how research data will be handled both during and after a research project, describing what data will be collected / generated, the methodology and standards followed, whether and how this data will be shared and/or made open, and how it will be curated and preserved. DMPs are living documents, updated when needed throughout the research process. More and more research funders require a DMP as a deliverable, but there are several reasons why DMPs are part of good research practices.\n\nLearning objectives:\n\n- Understand the importance of research data management;\n- Discover how a Data Management Plan (DMP) can help you be more efficient in your research;\n- Be aware of the European Comission’s requirements on research data;\n- Be able to start your own research data management plan.\n\nIn the second part of the workshop the participants will get to know tools and will start their own data management plan.\n\n<YouTube id=\"9-IyEKXiG0I\" caption=\"Antónia Correia - Data Management Plans\" />\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/6.1 Correia.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"correia-antonia\">\n\nAntónia Correia works as an open science project officer for FOSTER Plus, FIT4RRI and ON-MERRIT at Minho University.

The role of language in research practices tends to be considered secondary in STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), as there seems to be a tacit assumption that English is widely accepted as the language of communication. English tends to be promoted in (inter)national and European research and innovation policies – mainly written in English and with scarce reference to language use or multilingualism. In this context, SSH specific needs regarding scholarly communication in native languages has to be addressed: in those disciplines where language and concepts are very often not only means of communication but objects of research themselves, the use of mother tongue is indispensable for in-depth understanding, and knowledge co-creation and sharing. In this setting, the challenge of multilingualism should sit alongside the concept of ‘bibliodiversity’, coined by the International Alliance of Independent Publishers, which refers to “cultural diversity applied to the world of books”; that is, underlining the need to encompass a diversity of languages, scientific areas, publication formats, and actors. There are firm grounds to state that bibliodiversity, through multilingual publishing, is an efficient way of protecting national languages and enhancing different academic rhetorical traditions, by reaching specialists and wider audiences in a complementary way. Therefore, it is of the utmost relevance to understand how bibliodiversity, in its manifold formats and multilingual forms, is promoted through innovative practices and high-level programmatic involvement. In order to illustrate this, a presentation will be made of the OPERAS consortium at large, as well as of the more particular scope of the recently EU funded project TRIPLE. Finally, a practical approach will be made taking as reference the UC Digitalis ecosystem, based on the experience of Coimbra University Press.\n\n<YouTube\n  id=\"wwKvMNsMe2w\"\n  caption=\"Delfim Leão - Innovative Publishing Practices in the Arts and Humanities\"\n/>\n\n<Download />\n\n<Speakers>\n  <Speaker speaker=\"leão-delfim\">\n    Delfim Leão is Full Professor at the Institute of Classical Studies and currently Vice-Rector for Culture and Open Science at the University of Coimbra.

It will introduce different categories and types of research data, make the link with research fields and methods, and add some comments about differences between SS&H and STM. It will also question the future of the distinction between documents and data, in the environment of content mining. Other issues will be addressed for further discussion: sharing and reusage of data; impact and evaluation of data; the link between document, data life cycle and the research process; identification, curation and preservation; and the function of data in the new context of open science. What is data? What is NOT data? What is functional and dysfunctional in the field of data management and data publishing?

The missing link between Digital Humanities and Open Science_\n\nTransparency, interoperability, free and open access are values commonly shared by Digital Humanities projects. But the mere publication and display of content on the web is not enough to make a project part of Open Science. As a new way of doing science by allowing the users to process the underlying data of a publication with tools, instead of just perusing it, Open Science requires Open Data and Open Process on top of Open Access. In this session, we will explore how digital editions, historically a most important part of DH, can bridge the gap between Open Access and Open Science. Using examples of digital editions based on the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) (TEI), we will see how to integrate the reflection on Open Data in an edition project as early as the conception phase, in close relationship with the theory about a text that is, in the end, a critical edition – a theory based on data.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/2.1-Open-Critical-Edition.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"burghart-marjorie\">\n\n[Marjorie Burghart](http://marjorie.burghart.online.fr/?q=en) is a research fellow at the CNRS (French National Center of Scientific Research) and she is working in the [CIHAM UMR 5648](http://ciham.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/) research center in Lyon and is specialised in medieval history and computer science.

Methods and tutorials to create a Data Management Plan_\n\nWith the growth of the Open Science movement in the past few years, researchers have been increasingly encouraged by their home institutions, their funders, and by the public, to share the data they produce. A new model of data sharing is emerging, and this issue is becoming more and more crucial for the scientific community and for national and international research policy. As shown by the [OECD in 2007](http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/38500813.pdf), public granting agencies hope that publicly funded research projects would give access to the data produced within their work, in order to provide new resources for economic development. And with the extension of the Open Research Data Pilot in Horizon 2020, H2020 beneficiaries have to make their research data “[findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf)”, and are therefore asked to provide a Data Management Plan (or DMP) to this end.\n\nMore than a constraint, this new model of openness brings direct benefits for researchers. Sharing their data allows the researchers to organise and retrieve them effectively, to ensure their security, to collaborate with fellow researchers within the same discipline or from other disciplines, to reduce costs by avoiding duplication of data collection, to make easier validation of results, to increase the impact and visibility of their research outputs.\n\n<Link href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01416978\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n**Marie Puren** and **Charles Riondet**, Ph.D., are junior researchers in Digital Humanities at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en)) in Paris, members of the [Alpage laboratory](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/alpage-wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Accueil) (INRIA – Paris Diderot University).

A link to a service, that makes it possible to explore the data in question yourself, might be more valuable than a picture. But these types of online resources and/or the infrastructures they live in are constantly evolving. Which effectively leads to dead links or links to a different version of the resource. PID systems can help with keeping the locations of resources up to date as well as store information about what the resource is.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/4.1-Kosarko.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"košarko-ondřej\">\n\nOndřej Košarko is a programmer working at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics ([UFAL](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-kosarko)), Prague, Czech Republic.

CTS is not bibliographic database or commentary framework, but a protocol intended to serve use-cases like those. CTS consists of a specification for URN citations, and a specification for a service-protocol. CTS was created for the Homer Multitext to address that project’s need to integrate (a) an open-ended diversity of texts, (b) many specific versions of the same text, some digital, some in print, and some in manuscript, many fragmentary, (c) at arbitrary levels of abstraction (“Iliad Book 2”) or specificity (“The third letter sigma at Iliad 1.2 on the Venetus A manuscript”), (d) with the assumption that technologies for storage, retrieval, and display will change completely during the project’s lifetime. This presentation will introduce CTS as a possible model for persistent identifiers in a large-scale, distributed digital library. The first part of the presentation will offer an overview of the protocol, the CTS URN citation scheme, and the CTS Service requests, with attention to applications and limitations of CTS. The second part will present how the Open Greek and Latin project of the University of Leipzig is implementing CTS and the tools it is making available for editors, publishers, and consumers of CTS texts.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/4.2-Munson.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"munson-matthew\">\n\nMatthew Munson received an MA from the University of Virginia in Religious Studies, his thesis studying the use of the Greek word for law (νόμος) in the letters of the Apostle Paul.

One of the problems is the fact that the most common procedures have been fine-tuned to the so-called hard sciences and as such are ill adapted the SSH disciplines. While abundant information exists about research practices, disciplinary biases and dissemination traditions in STEM fields, the situation is at least contrasted between Nordic and Southern countries with regards to the monitoring of the research production/outputs in SSH disciplines. This presentation will briefly introduce the [COST Action CA15137](http://enressh.eu/), dedicated to the creation of a network of evaluators for the SSH disciplines, then will focus on the needs and the challenges of data collection for an informed peer evaluation of the SSH.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/5.3-Galleron.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"galleron-ioana\">\n\n[Ioana Galleron](http://www.licorn-research.fr/galleron.html) is a Senior lecturer in French language and literature.

The project entails retrodigitisation and transformation of the existing records into a coherent database as well as the development of data analysis tools for literary researchers. PBL is a specialized bibliography containing records about various types of materials concerning literature and literary scholarship (e.g. literary works, books, journals, magazines, articles, documents, dramas, movies, TV programs, conferences, awards, etc.), which are annotated in the unique semantic framework. In that respect it is similar to other national projects such as ABELL (Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature). The online database contains records for 1988-2002 with printed volumes covering the period 1939-1987. In my presentation I would like to focus on the following issues:\n\n- Challenges: the methodological problems of dealing with data collected during a long stretch of 60 years, including the conversion of OCR'd scans into a database.\n- Standards: choosing the right ontology for the data and mapping our resources onto it.\n- Interoperability: plans to link the resources with LOD cloud and other bibliographies (hopefully with the Bibliography of Czech Literature too).\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/6.3-Maciej.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"maryl-maciej\">\n\nDeputy Director, Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n\n## Creation of Open Data Resources: Benefits of Cooperation: Kira Kovalenko & Eveline Wandl-Vogt\n\n### Abstract\n\n_Creation of Open Data Resources: Benefits of Cooperation._\n\nIn the presentation we a going to discuss about cooperation between Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (Austrian Academy of Sciences) and Institute for Linguistic Studies (Russian Academy of Sciences).

All the projects will be implemented with the use of cutting-edge technologies and will be available online.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/6.4-Kovalenko.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"kovalenko-kira\">\n\nKira Kovalenko, Institute for Linguistic Studies (Russia) &amp; Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (Austria) &amp; Eveline Wandl-Vogt, Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (Austria).\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n\n## Network of Dutch War Sources: pursuits and goals: Tessa Free\n\n### Abstract\n\n_The Network of Dutch War sources._\n\nIn Holland, there are around four hundred organizations keeping a collection from or about the Netherlands in the Second World War. The program ‘Network of Dutch war sources’ (Netwerk Oorlogsbronnen) intends to make the geographically scattered sources digital findable and usable. We do that by engaging in or leading small projects with several participating organizations. For example creating a second world war – thesaurus, implemented in collection management systems. The use of OCR and NER-techniques to make millions of documents accessible on a document level. And adding persistent geographical codes to sources to enhance searching with a focus on location.\n\nThe Network of Dutch War sources is a program of ‘NIOD institute for war holocaust and genocide’.

How, without difficulty, can an article be found?_\n\nThe primary talking point of it is about the efficiency of Open Access in social sciences and humanities. The talk will therefore introduce the issue of a case study: “the method of online academic reviews and the alleged delay of post-Holocaust Sociology”. The presentation will confer about this method, halfway between hemerographia and metasociology, and about the measurement of some important indexes, such as “the speed of publication” of research and “the scientific impact” of it on the academic public. It argues that open access and usability of data need to be understood as more than simply a kind of digital research. The project will support the circulation and connecting of data and will be linked with well versed institutions.\n\nThis can happen best when there are energetic institutional means for the researchers: when they, to all intents and purposes, try to claim what they want is when digital democracy becomes challenging, as it is now, in Europe.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/6.6-Messina.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"messina-adele-valeria\">\n\nAdele Valeria Messina, University of Calabria.\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n\n## Case Studies on digital content reuse in the context of Europeana Cloud: Eliza Papaki\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe use of digital content has, over the past couple of decades, become almost the norm for many researchers within the Humanities and Social Sciences. Curation of both digitised legacy data and born-digital content, however, makes it imperative that items are managed at an individual level in order for larger collections of data to be trusted and useful. Europeana is shifting focus from being a discovery portal of over 30 million digitised items to a platform that allows third parties to develop tools based on its content. In order to gather information about the potential use of existing collections in Europeana, research was conducted into developing an empirically-based, comprehensive list of User Requirements. Investigations included current data reuse within the sector, the quality of the content itself and identification of topics with which Europeana can be of most use.\n\nIn our investigations through the Europeana Cloud project, we took the approach from both users and providers. Topics were selected for trial using Europeana’s current content, and other potential resources, both of which were subjected to questioning: how useful was the data to them?; what tools or services could be used with it; what were the failings of the content and how might that be overcome? In this presentation, two of these topics have been selected as case studies: Conflict-related Population Displacement; and Children’s Literature.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/6.7-Papaki.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"papaki-eliza\">\n\nEliza Papaki, Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C., Greece.\n\n</Speaker>\n\n</Speakers>\n","title":"Case studies","synthesis":"downloads/DARIAH_Winter_School-6-CaseStudies.pdf","speakers":["mounier-pierre","malínek-vojtěch","maryl-maciej","kovalenko-kira","free-tessa","messina-adele-valeria","papaki-eliza"]},{"body":"## Abstract\n\n_Do we still need peer-review? Datajournals as a way of reconsidering our evaluation culture and our understanding of research._\n\nNever had scholars had to write so many applications and so many reviews as nowadays. Peer-review has been institutionalized as the central regulation mechanism of the two core activities that are formulating a research question and its workflow on the one hand and criticizing its results on the other hand. Still, most scholars are deeply unsatisfied by a system in which they feel like they never really get to “do” research, but are rather stuck in a vicious circle of unproductive evaluations. While evaluation is perceived by scholars as more and more disconnected from research itself, the datajournal model developed by DARIAH in the context of the [episcience](https://www.episciences.org/) platform is aiming at re-harmonizing research and evaluation, allowing to integrate peer reviews as a contribution to the research and development process of an online resource, in a continuous (virtuous) feedback loop. The session will allow to address both benefits and challenges of datajournals, aiming more widely at initiating a constructive dialogue on publication and evaluation structures in the digital age.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/7.1-Baillot.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"baillot-anne\">\n\nAnne Baillot was a trainee civil servant at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris between 1995 and 1999.

Whereas in STM disciplines, the new dissemination paradigm means shifting from reader-pays model to author-pays model, the infamous “APC“, in humanities and social sciences that type of reconfiguration is simply not possible for many good reasons. Moreover, the dissemination of knowledge in those disciplines is mostly done through books and not solely in journals, which entails additional complications. Therefore, those who want to develop open access in SSH have to find their own solution, that fits with their specific ecosystem. Whether it be based on donations, grants, subscriptions, in kind contributions, crowdfunding or “freemium” model, the are many ongoing experimentations under development. A landscape of the different models and the main trends on the topic will be presented.\n\n<Download url=\"downloads/8.1-Mounier.pdf\" />\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"mounier-pierre\">\n\n[Pierre Mounier](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0691-6063) is deputy director of [OpenEdition](http://www.openedition.org/?lang=en), a comprehensive infrastructure based in France for open access publication and communication in the humanities and social sciences.

One of its central mission is to give visibility and provide structured access to large corpora of texts from Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic or the Baltic states, relating in particular to important epistemological paradigms of the Humanities such as structuralism, phenomenology, or critical theory. This objective implies not only the high-quality digitisation of textual sources, but also their translation at least into English. Given the still obscure nature of these corpora, however, it is hard to find anything more than punctual funding, and there is no prospect of even mild commercial success to finance these tasks in the systematic, long-term perspective that they require.\n\nThe solution explored by sdvig press is the development of thematic platforms that integrate Central and Eastern European corpora into better defined, more visible and more international contexts. We are developing three prototypes, of which the Open Commons of Phenomenology is the most advanced (the other two are [Structuralica](http://structuralica.org/) and [Pacem](http://pacem.io/)). Each of these platforms, at first, is conceived mainly as an exhaustive bio-bibliographical repository providing structured access (ideally) to all sources and references in its thematic field. Access to contents is wholly unrestricted, but a number of tools (advance search, lists, visualisations, etc.) are made available only to libraries through a subscription.\n\n<Link\n  links={[\n    \"https://prezi.com/ckdl-wi8a6vi/reseaux-du-structuralisme/\",\n    \"http://acta.structuralica.org/2016/08/01/209/\",\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<Speakers>\n\n<Speaker speaker=\"flack-patrick\">\n\nPatrick Flack is the managing director of [sdvig press](https://sdvigpress.org/), an open access, non-profit academic publishing house.

These data, which are usually very expensive to produce, are often lost at the end of the project. They are therefore rarely reused, due to a lack of financial, human and technical resources of the communities that produced them.
