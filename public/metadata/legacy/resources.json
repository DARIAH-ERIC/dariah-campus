An interdisciplinary scholar with research interests bridging the humanities, social sciences, information science and environmental science, she has authored one book and edited another and has completed two major digital publications and eighteen articles. She has raised approximately $1.8 million in extramural funding and currently holds grants from both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation.\nMostern's current research reconstructs the environmental history of the Yellow River as a human and natural system. She is studying the entire river basin (which stretches from the Tibetan plateau to the Pacific Ocean) during a timeframe of approximately 5,000 years in order to assess when, and to what degree, human activity in the upper and middle reaches of the river increased the risk of flooding on the densely populated lower course of the river. She is creating a digital atlas that includes a GIS (a digital mapping system) and database of the dates and locations of disasters and civil engineering works in the river basin. This data-rich atlas will support interdisciplinary advances in the understanding of large-scale human-environmental impact.\nMostern is also Principal Investigator of a collaborative initiative, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, to create a World-Historical Gazetteer that includes content and infrastructure for spatial linked open data to permit large-scale and long-term historical analysis and visualization.","avatar":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/people/images/5fa0916c594fe73eeaca0afa65f6b24e.jpg","width":700,"height":537,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAb/xAAiEAAABQIHAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBBIiBQcRExUzUWH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEQP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AK9uNAazv5NyRiJuOuIjIbSsqE2UbZp16zO734AAA0XIjoGk/9k="},"twitter":"@RuthMostern","website":"https://www.history.pitt.edu/people/ruth-mostern","orcid":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8219-7174"}],"editors":[{"id":"ryan-yann","firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Ryan"}],"tags":[{"id":"data-management","name":"Data management","description":"Data Management is a set of practices and techniques used by researchers to ensure that their data is organised, structured and easily reusable for future research"},{"id":"linked-open-data","name":"Linked Open Data","description":"Linked Open Data is a way of publishing structured data that allows linking to other related resources."},{"id":"spatial-humanities","name":"Spatial humanities","description":"Spatial Humanities is research that combines humanities, environmental sciences and geography-based practices to study physical, cognitive, perceptual and relational aspects of the human spatial experience"}],"categories":[{"id":"programming-historian","name":"Programming Historian","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/045d202c3afa37935ab30fde3aa90f5f.jpeg","width":2500,"height":1875,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAGAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAfEAABBAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMREgEEBQYWYXH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABgRAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEx/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC+t7TzaHLcl1hWF7Qp7uY8ABNQqesU84f/2Q=="},"description":"Programming Historian offers novice-friendly, peer-reviewed lessons that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching.","host":"Programming Historian"}],"featuredImage":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/posts/working-with-named-places-how-and-why-to-build-a-gazetteer/images/c18a4fa9115aee5fd95b6ef01279fee8.png","width":500,"height":344},"abstract":"A digital gazetteer records information associated with specific places.

First is to understand how researchers use these online platforms and how to train them to understand the changes data has undergone during the digitisation processes.

While IP rights can create barriers to access, reuse and transparency, she argues, they can also further creativity and innovation by providing revenue, and by protecting other values such as privacy/confidentiality, and integrity/authenticity. IP rights can also, in some circumstances, protect against the exploitation of individuals and communities. Framing IP rights in terms of a sometimes complex web of relationships, this presentation asks what role IP rights should play in ethically open science.","domain":"Social Sciences and Humanities","targetGroup":"Domain researchers","type":{"id":"video","name":"Video"},"remote":{"date":""},"licence":{"id":"ccby-4.0","name":"CCBY 4.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"},"uuid":"P089MgRgIKG3rOczZuQ5V","editors":[],"contributors":[]},{"id":"open-science-is-just-good-science","kind":"posts","title":"Open Science is Just Good Science","lang":"en","date":"2019-08-16","version":"1.0.0","authors":[{"id":"tennant-jon","firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Tennant"}],"tags":[{"id":"dh","name":"DH","description":"Digital Humanities (DH) is a scholarly discipline that deals with the use of computational methods in the study of the humanities"},{"id":"open-science","name":"Open science","description":"Open Science is the process or processes by which a scholar ensures that their research outputs, which might include data, publications and training activities, are available and open to all without restriction"}],"abstract":"In this lecture, Jon Tennant argues that 'Open Science' is 'good science', because it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and public good.

However, most importantly, it is also to create opportunities for people to meet and learn face-to-face. She explains that humanities scholars are more accustomed to using digital methods and tools in the initial (information gathering) and final (publication) stages of research. However, DARIAH, specifically, can help them to also use them in the core part of the research process - i.e. in organising, annotating, and enriching data.","authors":[{"id":"paavolainen-maija","firstName":"Maija","lastName":"Paavolainen"}],"categories":[{"id":"desir","name":"DESIR","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/b13d0d89c7c1f53fba270cd02e313f0d.jpg","width":4460,"height":2973,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAFAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX/xAAeEAABBAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIEEQMGEjJRcf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/8QAGBEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADESH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AL+37xPgZCI7Kc8HkTleOpoVRHhP0oiKqQR0izmZP//Z"},"description":"The H2020-funded project DESIR sets out to strengthen the sustainability of DARIAH and firmly establish it as a long-term leader and partner within arts and humanities communities.","host":"DARIAH-Campus"},{"id":"dariah","name":"DARIAH","image":{"src":"/_next/static/image/content/categories/images/8aa04ee5ec784cac20e10b626501d873.jpg","width":1500,"height":806,"blurDataURL":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAEAAgDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/xAAcEAABBQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAEDBBETIWH/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBf/EABoRAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQRElH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AJ+FtgvvVjrVRj5xDqNtzPURFNsRS1xwPJI//9k="},"description":"DARIAH is a pan-European infrastructure for arts and humanities scholars working with computational methods.
