On rare occasions, the enslaved were permitted to gather, and they would make music using improvised instruments. The lead singer would sing, giving their view of current events, and the choir would respond. Through music, news was spread and opinions were shaped. Music was one way that news spread from plantation to plantation as well, which could explain how Tula knew about slave uprisings abroad, inspiring him to lead a revolt in Curacao. He was tortured and killed, but the enslaved he left behind kept his legacy alive through songs.&nbsp; (Source: Rijksmuseum <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rijksmuseum.nl\/en\/stories\/exhibitions\/slavery\/\">Slavery: Ten True Stories<\/a>)<\/p>\n"},{"image":{"params":{"contentName":"Image","file":{"path":"images\/file-64f11275ac0f8.jpg","mime":"image\/jpeg","copyright":{"license":"U"},"width":960,"height":540}},"library":"H5P.Image 1.1","subContentId":"f75cf36d-5537-4c74-87af-01db065f6346","metadata":{"contentType":"Image","license":"U","title":"Untitled Image"}},"description":"<p>The glass beads help tell the story of Lohkay, an enslaved woman in Sint Maarten who tried to escape and had her breast cut off (earning her the moniker \u2018One-Tete Lohkay\u2019).
