# DARIAH-Campus

DARIAH-Campus (D-C) is a combined discovery layer and hosting platform for all learning resources
associated with DARIAH-EU. As a discovery layer, D-C links to existing, externally hosted, resources
(such as #dariahTeach, PARTHENOS etc.); and as a hosting platform, D-C offers a flexible framework
for developing and sharing web-based training materials, as well as capturing face-to-face events.

D-C materials are hosted and version-controlled in this GitHub repository and will be delivered to
the user as a Next.js-based overlay website.

Authors and contributors will be provided with comprehensive author guidelines on how to port
existing or create new content for D-C in Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text
formatting syntax. The overarching aim of D-C is to improve the openness, discoverability,
usability, and long-term sustainability of training resources, and to achieve best practice in the
production and management of open educational resources in the DARIAH ecosystem.

_Co-funded by the Horizon 2020 innovation and research programme of the European Union under grants
no. 731081 and 823782._
