# start of metadata for the resource.
title: Title of your resource
# if title has a colon in it, you have to "Put it: In Double Quotes". If it also includes a quote, "You Can:'nest them'"
date: 2022-08-27
# date that the resource was published on DARIAH-Campus
authors:
  - firstname-lastname
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml
contributors:
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml. Contributors are optional.
editors:
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml. Editors are optional.
categories:
  - dariah
# categories are what on the frontend we call sources, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/sources. A category listed here must exist in /contents/data/category.yaml. Do not create new categories unless you get a go-ahead from DARIAH-Campus editors.
tags:
  - first-tag
  - next-tag
# choose up to five keywords for the resource. All lower case, multiple words joined by hyphens (so-called "slugs"). A tag listed here must also exist in /contents/data/tag.yaml. If you think your resource needs a new tag, feel free to do so by listting it here and adding it (name, slug, description) in /contents/data/tag.yaml. The editors will try to keep the number of tags manageable. Tags are used to group resources around topics, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/tags
abstract: Short teaser about the contents of your resource.
# Abstracts are displayed in the previews of individual resources, like here: https://campus.dariah.eu/resources. Abstracts should be very short and briefly introduce what the resource is about. Abstracts are not displayed at the beginning of the actual content of the resource. If you want to use the same text as the teaser and as the first paragraph of your resource, you need to put that text as abstract in the metadata, and as a regular paragraph at the beginning of your resource.

This is where the longer abstract for your training resource begins. you can
make this section as long as you need to, although recommend you keep it below
250 words if possible.

Ideally it would also be useful to include some learning outcomes that users
might expect after following the training resource.
