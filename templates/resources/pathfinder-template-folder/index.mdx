title: Sample Pathfinder
#if title has a colon in it, you have to "Put it: In Double Quotes". If it also includes a quote, "You Can:'nest them'"

# date that the resource was published on DARIAH-Campus
authors:
  - firstname-lastname
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml
contributors:
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml. Contributors are optional.
editors:
  - firstname-lastname
# firstname-lastname is a slug pointing to the record in /contents/data/person.yaml. Editors are optional.
categories:
  - dariah
  - dariah-pathfinders
# categories are what on the frontend we call sources, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/sources. A category listed here must exist in /contents/data/category.yaml. Do not create new categories unless you get a go-ahead from DARIAH-Campus editors.
tags:
  - first-tag
  - next-tag
# choose up to five keywords for the resource. All lower case, multiple words joined by hyphens (so-called "slugs"). A tag listed here must also exist in /contents/data/tag.yaml. If you think your resource needs a new tag, feel free to do so by listting it here and adding it (name, slug, description) in /contents/data/tag.yaml. The editors will try to keep the number of tags manageable. Tags are used to group resources around topics, see: https://campus.dariah.eu/tags
abstract: Short teaser about the contents of your resource.
# Abstracts are displayed in the previews of individual resources, like here: https://campus.dariah.eu/resources. Abstracts should be very short and briefly introduce what the resource is about. Abstracts are not displayed at the beginning of the actual content of the resource. If you want to use the same text as the teaser and as the first paragraph of your resource, you need to put that text as abstract in the metadata, and as a regular paragraph at the beginning of your resource.

This is where the content for your training resource begins. This sample
resource contains guidance on all of the syntax you should need to use when
creating your resource. If you have additional needs, there are many markdown
guides online, and the DARIAH-Campus team are happy to give advice and guidance.

## Use second-level headings for main sections

This section is on basic text formatting. Do not use first-level headings: they
are reserved for the title of the resource, which is picked up directly from
your YAML metadata above.

To create paragraphs simply:

Insert a blank line to separate lines of text, just like above. Do not indent
new paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

You create **bold text** like this, using double asterisks, before and after the
word or phrase. To italicise text you _use single asterisks_ like this. You can
create **_bold and italic_** using triple asterisks.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> like this
>
> To include multiple paragraphs in the blockquote, add a > on the blank line
> inbetween as above.

Leave a line after the block quote.

Ordered lists:

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

Bullet point lists:

- Item
- Item
- Item

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or
one tab.

     <html>
      <head>
      </head>
     </html>

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [click here]) and
then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g.,
(https://dariah.eu)).

To find training resources [click here](https://dariah.eu).

To denote a word or phrase as code,within a line encase it in tick marks like
`<this>`

Finally, to turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle
brackets: <info@dariah.eu>

## Heading level two

This section concerns images.

You can insert an image as below:

![Description of image](images/imagename.png)

The path or URL to the image asset is in parentheses. The text in square
brackets is the alt text.

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and
then add the link in parentheses.

[![Description of image](images/imagename.png)](https://linktotheimage.eu)

### Heading level three

This section concerns videos.

To insert a YouTube video, use the following code:

<VideoCard
  title="Title of the Video"
  id="SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s"
  image="images/imagename.jpg"
/>

The "id" is the part of the url after the equals sign for a YouTube video. So,
for "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s" it is:
"SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s".

"image" allows you to choose a screenshot that will appear until the learner
clicks the play button.

An alternative is to directly embed the video from YouTube, which you do in the
following way:

<Youtube id="OqYJNUmhJzw" caption="Laurent Romary (Former DARIAH Director)" />

If you are including multiple videos, you might choose to arrange them in a grid
formation. You can do this in the following way:

<Grid>

  <Youtube id="OqYJNUmhJzw" caption="Laurent Romary (Former DARIAH Director)" />
  <Youtube id="iwz0uhEhtg4" caption="Jennifer Edmond (DARIAH Director)" />
  <Youtube id="soL0itkLYpk" caption="Frank Fischer (DARIAH Director)" />

</Grid>

#### Heading level four

Some extended syntax.

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header,
and use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on
either end of the table.

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

To add footnotes:

A simple footnote is created like this,[^1] and a longer one like
this.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Longer footnote with extra details and description.

Any questions can be directed to the DARIAH-Campus editors at any time in the
preparation process.
