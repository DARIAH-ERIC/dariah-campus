# DARIAH-CAMPUS

DARIAH-Campus (D-C) is a combined discovery layer and hosting platform for all
learning resources associated with DARIAH-EU. As a discovery layer, D-C links to
existing, externally hosted, resources (such as #dariahTeach, PARTHENOS etc.);
and as a hosting platform, D-C offers a flexible framework for developing and
sharing web-based training materials, as well as capturing face-to-face events.

D-C materials are hosted and version-controlled in this GitHub repository and
will be delivered to the user as a Gatsby-based overlay website.

**The official launch of DARIAH-CAMPUS is scheduled for November 2019.**

Authors and contributors will be provided with comprehensive author guidelines
on how to port existing or create new content for D-C in Markdown, a lightweight
markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The editorial processes are
still being finalised, but it is anticipated that they will culminate in
post-publication peer-review. All resources will receive DOIs and will be
deposited in Zenodo. The overarching aim of D-C is to improve the openness,
discoverability, usability, and long-term sustainability of training resources,
and to achieve best practice in the production and management of open
educational resources in the DARIAH ecosystem.

_Co-funded by the Horizon 2020 innovation and research programme of the European
Union under grant no. 731081._
