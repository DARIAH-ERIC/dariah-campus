# DARIAH-CAMPUS

DARIAH-Campus (D-C) is a combined discovery layer and hosting platform for all
learning resources associated with DARIAH-EU. As a discovery layer, D-C links to
existing, externally hosted, resources (such as #dariahTeach, PARTHENOS etc.);
and as a hosting platform, D-C offers a flexible framework for developing and
sharing web-based training materials, as well as capturing face-to-face events.

D-C materials are hosted and version-controlled in this GitHub repository and
will be delivered to the user as a Gatsby-based overlay website.

**The official launch of DARIAH-CAMPUS is scheduled for November 2019.**

Authors and contributors will be provided with comprehensive author guidelines
on how to port existing or create new content for D-C in Markdown, a lightweight
markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The editorial processes are
still being finalised, but it is anticipated that they will culminate in
post-publication peer review. All resources will receive DOIs and will be
deposited in Zenodo. The overarching aim of D-C is to improve the openness,
discoverability, usability, and long-term sustainability of training resources,
and to achieve best practice in the production and management of open
educational resources in the DARIAH ecosystem.

_Co-funded by the Horizon 2020 innovation and research programme of the European
Union under grant no. 731081._

### Contributing to DARIAH-CAMPUS

#### First-time contribution

1. **In GitHub Desktop, create a new branch off of master.**  
   Call it by your name, then go watch the movie "Call me by your name" if you
   haven't seen it already.
2. **Do your work.**
3. **Commit your work.**  
   This will save your initial work to _your_ branch _locally_.
4. **Publish your branch.** This will save your intial work to _your_ branch
   _remotely_.
5. **Create a pull request.**  
   This will alert the repository admin person that there are changes that
   should be merged into the master branch, i.e. made public.

#### Subsequent contributions

Before you make your next contribution, you have to make sure that your local
branch is up to date. Remember, you created your special little branch off of
the master at some point, but other people may have contributed to the master in
the meantime. So it's very important that you follow this procedure _every time_
you start doing work on your branch again.

1. **In GitHub Desktop, in your branch, fetch origin.**  
   This will check whether there were any changes made to _your_ branch
   _remotely_.
2. **If GitHub Desktop instructs you to pull origin, pull origin.**  
   This will make sure that _your local_ and _your remote branch_ are in sync.
   Which is important, if you have, for instance, used a different computer to
   commit and publish etc. Or if, God forbid, somebody messed around with your
   branch. They shouldn't. But it did happen at least once. And Toma was to
   blame :)
3. **Branch > Update from master**  
   This will now, in addition, update _your local branch_ with all the
   contributions that have meanwhile been merged into the master from the other
   branches. Remember, each contributor works in their own branch.
4. **If GitHub Desktop instructs you to push origin, push origin.**  
   This will make sure that the changes from the master branch, which you've
   added to _your local_ branch in the previous step, will also make it to _your
   remote branch_. With your local and remote branch fully updated and sync you
   can finally get to do your work.
5. **Do your work.**
6. **Commit your work.**  
   This will save your work to _your_ branch _locally_.
7. **Push origin.**  
   This will save your work to _your_ branch _remotely_.
8. **Create a pull request.**  
   This will alert the repository admin person that there are changes that
   should be merged into the master branch, i.e. made public.
