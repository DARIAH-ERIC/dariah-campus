    PhD thesis about the link between Protestantism and Democracy. In order to
    deliver a better understanding of this relation, he analyses the complex
    thought patterns and intellectual networks at the core of this idea, which
    brought many protestant thinkers and political actors to find themselves
    sharing common values.

    Loup BERNARD is teaching at the University of Strasbourg since 2007. His
    work as an archaeologist on the Celtic settlements and territories in
    Provence and Southern Germany led him to develop an online GIS, ArkeoGIS. It
    is a multilingual, multichronological online and free tool. The platform
    allows the aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share
    existing data between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over
    a decade of use, ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking
    open spatialized data and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to
    professional researchers.

    languages and AI - natural language processing (Tilburg, Netherlands). After
    spending several years on training algorithms to understand what people do
    when they must talk to a machine, for example about about train connections
    ('Computer, I never told you I wanted to go to Mügli am See! Restart
    again!'), or when they must sort zoology metadata into museum databases
    ('Computer, 'dead humid leaves' should be the finding place of this animal,
    not the cause of its death!'), she decided to go back to her roots, and has
    taken up a position at the Research Institute for Linguistics (Budapest,
    Hungary). Currently, she is affiliated to the Digital Humanities Lab of the
    University of Basel (Switzerland), where she supports research in Humanities
    and Social Sciences via tools and approaches from language technology.
