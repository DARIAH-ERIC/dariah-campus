    allows the aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share
    existing data between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over
    a decade of use, ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking
    open spatialized data and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to

    hackathons herself. Her work has included studying how game jam and
    hackathon formats can be adapted to facilitate creativity and support
    academic processes, such as teaching, learning and researching. Her research
    interests include how processes of imagining, designing and developing
    technology can be democratised for example via formats which accelerates
    design processes, and via maker materials which lowers the barrier to
    technology development. She is also one of the founders of an Aarhus-based
