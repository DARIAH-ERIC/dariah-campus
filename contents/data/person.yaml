    Loup BERNARD is teaching at the University of Strasbourg since 2007. His
    work as an archaeologist on the Celtic settlements and territories in
    Provence and Southern Germany led him to develop an online GIS, ArkeoGIS. It
    is a multilingual, multichronological online and free tool. The platform
    allows the aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share
    existing data between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over
    a decade of use, ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking
    open spatialized data and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to
    professional researchers.
