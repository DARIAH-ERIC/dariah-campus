## Abstract

The Data and Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH) operates as a platform
for humanities research data and ensures access to this data and promotes the
networking of data with other databases (linked open data), to ad value for
further research and the interested public. As a competence center for digital
methods and long-term use of digital data, it supports the hermeneutically
oriented humanities in the use of state-of-the-art digital research methods.
Focusing on qualitative data and associated digital objects (images, sound,
video, etc.) in the cultural heritage field.

Long-term archiving or access is a major topic after the digital turn in the
humanities, as many funding agencies such as the Swiss National Science
Foundation and the European Commission are now requiring that a data management
plan be in place in order to receive research funding. This new imperative
raises many questions in the scientific community. This papers points out the
contributions of the DaSCH for digital humanities researchers and the advantages
of interoperability.
