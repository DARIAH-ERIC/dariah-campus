## Abstract

The technicality of network visualization applied to history and its relative
novelty often result in a superficial use of a software, limited to describing a
situation immediately extracted from a data set. This approach is justified in
the exploratory phase of an analysis in most cases where the network is very
explicitly present in the object studied. But the complexity of the entanglement
of historical actors, places, institutions or temporal sequences makes finer
modeling necessary if we want to go beyond a simplistic "datafication".

To encourage curiosity towards other modes of analysis and put the data modeling
(and therefore the historical sources) at the center of the research process,
this article attempts to discuss what makes a historical network, its
components, its relationships, its layers and its different facets. It offers a
kind of visual guide to help historians follow a multilayer framework to think
their research object from another (multidimensional) angle.
