## Abstract

After more than a decade online, the ArkeoGIS project illustrates the benefits
of data sharing. Thanks to free software bricks, and with the precious help of
the TGIR HUMA-NUM of the CNRS, this spreadsheet sharing platform has shown its
efficiency. Each user can freely choose his language, his chronology and the
data he wishes to share. With more than 100 database extracts from
professionals, research grants and advanced students, the tool now offers more
than 100,000 spatialized information about the past - in the Upper Rhine and
also worldwide according to users needs. In this contribution, good practices,
brakes and accelerators of data sharing by archaeologists and (paleo-)
environmentalists within the ArkeoGIS platform will be discussed, with the hope
of generating more sharing in the digital humanities.

Loup BERNARD is teaching at the University of Strasbourg since 2007. His work as
an archaeologist on the Celtic settlements and territories in Provence and
Southern Germany led him to develop an online GIS, ArkeoGIS. It is a
multilingual, multichronological online and free tool. The platform allows the
aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share existing data
between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over a decade of use,
ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking open spatialized data
and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to professional researchers.
