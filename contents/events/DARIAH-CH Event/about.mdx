## Description

After a [first workshop](https://www.unine.ch/dariah-ch/home.html) held in
November 2018, the University of Neuchâtel hosted a second DARIAH-CH workshop on
December 5-6 2019.

For this event, young scholars were invited to present their research in depth
and to discuss together methodological, data management and research workflow
issues.

In addition, DARIAH organised during these two days training sessions on
sustainable data workflows in the Arts and Humanities by the DARIAH Open Science
officer, Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra.

We are happy to present on DARIAH-Campus the papers resulting from this meeting.
