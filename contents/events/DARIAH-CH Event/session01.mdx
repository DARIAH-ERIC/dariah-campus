## Abstract

In the 16th century, ballots were held in a significant number of cities and
villages under supervision of the Swiss cantons in order to choose between the
reformed ideas and the teachings of the Roman Church. This workflow paper aims
to demonstrate how using the symogih.org information system gives new insights
in crucial aspects of the voting process. Developed by the LARHRA in Lyon,
[symogih.org](symogih.org) is an open modular platform which stores
geohistorical information and allows researchers to share knowledge in a
collaborative environment, using a CIDOC CRM compatible, event-centred
extensible model. It allows to collect and link together data in order to
identify and analyse key configurations and processes about these ballots on
faith, such as the definition of questions submitted to the voters; the
identification of the actors allowed to cast a vote; the networks of alliances
and overlapping jurisdictions characterising the relations between communes,
parishes and magistrates. The paper will therefore show how digital humanities
contributes to a better understanding why a vote was considered as the right
path to a wise religious choice and under which circumstances such ballots were
organized in Reformation times.

Marc Aberlé works at the University of Neuchâtel as a member of the SNF-funded
[Reformation, local assemblies and ballots](http://p3.snf.ch/project-162968)
project. He is currently writing a PhD thesis about the link between
Protestantism and Democracy. In order to deliver a better understanding of this
relation, he analyses the complex thought patterns and intellectual networks at
the core of this idea, which brought many protestant thinkers and political
actors to find themselves sharing common values.
