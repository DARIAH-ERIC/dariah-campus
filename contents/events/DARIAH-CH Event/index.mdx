# "Sharing the Experience: Workflows for the Digital Humanities"

## Université de Neuchâtel, December 2019

In December 2019, the University of Neuchâtel hosted a second Swiss DARIAH
workshop, organised by DARIAH-EU, the University of Neuchâtel and the SIB Swiss
Institute of Bioinformatics within the DESIR project. Young scholars were
invited to present their research in depth and to discuss together
methodological, data management and research workflow issues. We are happy to
present the papers resulting from this meeting.
