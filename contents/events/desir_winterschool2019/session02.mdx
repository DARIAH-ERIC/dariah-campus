## Abstract

In the Humanities domain, we see a broad diversity of conceptions on what
constitutes scholarly data and such conceptions carry tacit assumptions that
could and should define domain- or discipline-specific approaches to research
data sharing workflows. In this workshop, participants will be encouraged to
examine their own scholarly practices and those of others, refining our
responses to the fundamental question: “what are Humanities research data?”
After a warm-up session dedicated to epistemological reflections on the role of
data within humanities research, the session gently introduce the participants
to the basics in research data management, data services and the FAIR principles
in a humanities context, just to see how all these at first possibly fairly
abstract new concepts help do more effective research if they are
well-translated into community practices.

Clearly, the generic research data management guidelines do not always align
well with the cultural, conceptual and epistemological complexity of research
data in the arts and humanities and the many entailments of this complexity such
as:

- Data comes in the humanities in a wide variety of source types, formats and
  corpus sizes. The word ‘data’ itself is hardly used and mostly replaced by the
  notion of primary source;
- Researchers usually lack know-how as to how to deal with the various
  dimensions of data management: documentation, hosting, identification or
  re-use condition are not part of the education curricula in the humanities;
- A fundamental difference between the epistemic cultures of hard sciences and
  arts and humanities is that in the arts and humanities the wide range of
  scholarly information referred to as cultural heritage data are not autonomous
  products of research projects but are deeply embedded in the memory of the
  institutions (museums, libraries, archives) that preserve, curate and
  (co)produce them;
- These institutions are not only data providers as ownership of heritage data
  is inherently shared between them, the researcher communities, the public and
  the people and cultures that give rise to the objects in question.
- Access to and the digital availability of cultural heritage as the primary
  condition of research in the majority of humanities disciplines that defines
  the reusability and accessibility of scholarship built on them.

During the session, we are going to address these challenges one by one in the
context of responsible open data sharing practices. Participants are encouraged
to discuss data management issues related to their own projects (or project
ideas) ideas and to contact the trainers beforehand.

Erzsébet started her job as Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU in March 2018. She
studied comparative literature studies, cultural studies and linguistics at the
University of Szeged (Hungary) as well as at the Eötvös Loránd University in
Budapest. She received her PhD in Cultural Linguistics summa cum laude in 2018
at Eötvös Loránd University for her corpus study of the evolution of certain
Hungarian word-formation schemata. After graduating, she had been teaching
linguistics and Hungarian as foreign language at the Eötvös Loránd University as
well as at the Fachhochschule Burgenland in Eisenstadt, Austria. In 2016, her
commitment to democracy in science led her to join ScienceOpen, a research
evaluation and discovery platform, as Content Integration Manager and open
science advocate. Her role at DARIAH enables her to merge the 2 main pillars of
her professional life: humanities and open science. She is responsible for
fostering and implementing open science practices across DARIAH and its
cooperating partners and contributes to the design and implementation of open
science policy statements, guidelines and service related to the open
dissemination of research results in the humanities
