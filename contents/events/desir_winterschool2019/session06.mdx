## Abstract

In this workshop we will underline the importance and the role that data
management plans play in good data management. A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a
formal document that specifies how research data will be handled both during and
after a research project - describing what data will be collected / generated,
the methodology and standards followed, whether and how this data will be shared
and/or made open, and how it will be curated and preserved. DMPs are living
documents, updated when needed throughout the research process. More and more
research funders require a DMP as a deliverable, but there are several reasons
why DMPs are part of good research practices.

Learning objectives:

- Understand the importance of research data management;
- Discover how a Data Management Plan (DMP) can help you be more efficient in
  your research;
- Be aware of the European Comission’s requirements on research data;
- Be able to start your own research data management plan.

In the second part of the workshop the participants will get to know tools and
will start their own data management plan.
