## Abstract

The workshop intends to approach challenges and innovative models related to
multilingualism within bibliodiversity in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH).
The role of language in research practices tends to be considered secondary in
STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), since there
seems to be a tacit assumption that English is widely accepted as the language
of communication. Besides, it tends to be promoted in (inter)national and
European research and innovation policies – mainly written in English and with
no or scarce reference to language use or multilingualism. In this context, SSH
specific needs regarding scholarly communication in native languages has to be
addressed: in those disciplines where language and concepts are very often not
only means of communication but objects of research themselves, the use of
mother tongue is indispensable for in-depth understanding, and knowledge
co-creation and sharing. In this setting, the challenge of multilingualism
should lay on the concept of ‘bibliodiversity’, coined by the International
Alliance of Independent Publishers, which refers to “cultural diversity applied
to the world of books” – thereof, underlining the need to encompass a diversity
of languages, scientific areas, publication formats, and actors. There are firm
grounds to state that bibliodiversity, through multilingual publishing, is an
efficient way of protecting national languages and enhancing different academic
rhetorical traditions, by reaching specialists and wider audiences in a
complementary way. Therefore, it is of the utmost relevance to understand how
bibliodiversity, in its manifold formats and multilingual forms, is promoted
through innovative practices and high-level programmatic involvement. In order
to illustrate this, a presentation will be made of the OPERAS consortium at
large, as well as of the more particular scope of the recently EU funded project
TRIPLE. Finally, a practical approach will be made taking as reference the UC
Digitalis ecosystem, based on the experience of Coimbra University Press.
