## Abstract

_Keynote_

Where our commitments lie in safeguarding our collective cultural memory? How
the overwhelming and unstoppable digital revolution changes our social, cultural
and scholarly life and how it leads us to rethink and reshape our priorities? In
her keynote speech, Prof. Fernanda Rollo shows us how the global societal
challenges and sustainable development goals of our age shape data challenges
and responsibilities of the Digital Humanities. She defines 7 key areas that
shall directly influence new approaches to data management in the arts and
humanities:

- Awareness and training
- Digital heritage
- The frightening and overwhelming loss of digital heritage
- Preservation of digital heritage
- Organization of digital heritage
- Collaborative work
- A cultural change

The second half of the talk outlines how pillars of the Open Science paradigm
(such as Citizen Science, training and advocacy, Open Access publishing models,
infrastructures, new research metrics) are instrumental in tackling these
issues.
