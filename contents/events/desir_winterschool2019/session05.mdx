## Abstract

As researchers, we are both creators of intellectual works and users of others'
works. Copyright addresses the proper balance between the interests of creators
and the possibility of reuse by the public. We will therefore look at principles
of copyright and statutory licenses for research and education and investigate
the provisions of the recent EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single
Market. In addition, we will discuss how Open licenses like Creative Commons
work in theory and practice and how we can employ them to ensure both widespread
re-use of our intellectual outputs and proper attribution.
