## Abstract

The session started with a short summary of an ongoing research project
exploring strategies practitioners and researchers use to communicate and
collaborate and, ideally, share data based on mutually understood data
management strategies.

Based on this summary, discussion questions for participants were posed, and the
follow up session focussed on collaboratively discussing and exploring RDM
practices.

A key goal for this workshop was to present, review and discuss strategies for
enhancing communication about data management across disciplines within the DH
and cultural heritage communities.
