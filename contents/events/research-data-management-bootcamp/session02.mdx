## Abstract

Data that can be collected from social media and other web platforms are
currently being used as a new type of research data across academic disciplines,
for example, to study online communication or to learn about users’ behavior or
opinions. While the corresponding research area is growing, a lot of questions
also about research methods and potential standards are arising, e.g., about
representativeness and reproducibility. But discussions also increasingly focus
on concerns about research ethics and data protection. A lot of this is work in
progress and only a few standards or best practices for research designs or for
documenting and sharing this type of research data exist.

In this session, some of the key challenges related to questions of research
ethics with a focus on data protection concerns in the area of social media as
research data will be introduced. The session aims at providing some first
insights for participants about critical questions when working with this new
type of research data and point out useful resources as references.
