## Abstract

This session aims to offer training resources to adapt to your institutional
context, helping researchers to do the following:

- Understand why they should budget for the costs of making data FAIR, and
  keeping it FAIR, and include these costs in grant applications
- Appreciate the benefits that services may provide to justify their costs
- Know about the different kinds of data management costs, including costs that
  funding bodies may allow to be charged to projects
- Apply a costing guide to help budget for the costs that may arise in preparing
  data to be FAIR
- Share experiences and expectations about costing the preparation of FAIR data
