# Economy of Open Access & Open Data Publication

## Economic Models for Open Access Publications: Pierre Mounier

### Abstract

_Economic models for Open Access publications_

The development of open access in humanities and social sciences faces a major
challenge: sustainability. Whereas in STM disciplines, the new dissemination
paradigm means shifting from reader-pays model to author-pays model, the
infamous “APC“, in humanities and social sciences that type of reconfiguration
is simply not possible for many good reasons. Moreover, the dissemination of
knowledge in those disciplines is mostly done through books and not solely in
journals, which entails additional complications. Therefore, those who want to
develop open access in SSH have to find their own solution, that fits with their
specific ecosystem. Whether it be based on donations, grants, subscriptions, in
kind contributions, crowdfunding or “freemium” model, the are many ongoing
experimentations under development. A landscape of the different models and the
main trends on the topic will be presented.

## Repository-as-a-Service: An Experimental Model for the Sustainable Curation and Funding of Large Niche Corpora in the Humanities: Patrick Flack

### Abstract

_Repository-as-a-Service: An Experimental Model for the Sustainable Curation and
Funding of Large Niche Corpora in the Humanities._

sdvig press is a non-profit academic publishing platform dedicated to supporting
the dissemination and linking of knowledge in the Humanities between Eastern,
Central and Western Europe. One of its central mission is to give visibility and
provide structured access to large corpora of texts from Russia, Poland, the
Czech Republic or the Baltic states, relating in particular to important
epistemological paradigms of the Humanities such as structuralism,
phenomenology, or critical theory. This objective implies not only the
high-quality digitisation of textual sources, but also their translation at
least into English. Given the still obscure nature of these corpora, however, it
is hard to find anything more than punctual funding, and there is no prospect of
even mild commercial success to finance these tasks in the systematic, long-term
perspective that they require.

The solution explored by sdvig press is the development of thematic platforms
that integrate Central and Eastern European corpora into better defined, more
visible and more international contexts. We are developing three prototypes, of
which the Open Commons of Phenomenology is the most advanced (the other two are
[Structuralica](http://structuralica.org/) and [Pacem](http://pacem.io/)). Each
of these platforms, at first, is conceived mainly as an exhaustive
bio-bibliographical repository providing structured access (ideally) to all
sources and references in its thematic field. Access to contents is wholly
unrestricted, but a number of tools (advance search, lists, visualisations,
etc.) are made available only to libraries through a subscription.

<Speaker speaker="patrick-flack">

Patrick Flack is the managing director of
[sdvig press](https://sdvigpress.org/), an open access, non-profit academic
publishing house. He is also associate member of the Central-European Institute
for Philosophy (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague). Since completing his PhD in
2011 (Comparative Literature, Charles University in Prague), he has worked in
Helsinki, Leuven and Berlin as a post-doctoral researcher funded by the Swiss
National Scientific Foundation. His research focuses on structuralism and a
trans-cultural, interdisciplinary approach to its historiography. With sdvig
press, he is currently developing a number of open access thematic platforms –
such as the [Open Commons of Phenomenogy](http://ophen.org/) – designed to
function as sustainable infrastructural and communication hubs for their
respective scientific communities. The development of these platforms is linked
directly with international institutions (Husserl Archives, Czech National
Library, etc.), embedding their research projects, archival holdings and
editorial outputs.
