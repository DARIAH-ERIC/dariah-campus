# Data Journals & Editorialization of Open Data: Anne Baillot & Marie Puren

## Abstract

_Do we still need peer-review? Datajournals as a way of reconsidering our
evaluation culture and our understanding of research._

Never had scholars had to write so many applications and so many reviews as
nowadays. Peer-review has been institutionalized as the central regulation
mechanism of the two core activities that are formulating a research question
and its workflow on the one hand and criticizing its results on the other hand.
Still, most scholars are deeply unsatisfied by a system in which they feel like
they never really get to “do” research, but are rather stuck in a vicious circle
of unproductive evaluations. While evaluation is perceived by scholars as more
and more disconnected from research itself, the datajournal model developed by
DARIAH in the context of the [episcience](https://www.episciences.org/) platform
is aiming at re-harmonizing research and evaluation, allowing to integrate peer
reviews as a contribution to the research and development process of an online
resource, in a continuous (virtuous) feedback loop. The session will allow to
address both benefits and challenges of datajournals, aiming more widely at
initiating a constructive dialogue on publication and evaluation structures in
the digital age.
