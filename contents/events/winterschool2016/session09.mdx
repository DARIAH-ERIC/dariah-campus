# Infrastructure & Platform

## Contrasting Platforms and Infrastructures as Configurations for Data Sharing: Jean Christophe Plantin

### Abstract

_Contrasting platforms and infrastructures as configurations for data sharing._

This talk will discuss the impact on scholarship when data sharing is
increasingly organized by social media platforms. It does so by contrasting
these entities with existing data infrastructures that acquire, curate, and
process these data for archiving and further dissemination. The analysis of
routine, procedures, and everyday work of data processing staff at a social
science data archive will provide elements to detail the “regime of care” that
define infrastructure towards research data, and how it contrasts with digital
intermediaries in organizing data circulation.

## Huma-Num: A French Infrastructure for Open Research Data in Humanities: Nicolas Larrousse

### Abstract

_Research Data Dissemination And Preservation: A Vision From Huma-Num, A French
Infrastructure Dedicated To Humanities._

In the field of Humanities and Social Sciences, the production of digital or
scanned data has increased considerably in recent years. These data, which are
usually very expensive to produce, are often lost at the end of the project.
They are therefore rarely reused, due to a lack of financial, human and
technical resources of the communities that produced them. This talk will
present the general approach, both technical and educational, used by Huma-Num
infrastructure to address these issues.
