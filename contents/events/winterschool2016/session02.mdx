# Open Critical Edition. The Missing Link Between Digital Humanities and Open Science: Emmanuelle Morlock &amp; Marjorie Burghart

## Abstract

_Open Critical Edition. The missing link between Digital Humanities and Open
Science_

Transparency, interoperability, free and open access are values commonly shared
by Digital Humanities projects. But the mere publication and display of content
on the web is not enough to make a project part of Open Science. As a new way of
doing science by allowing the users to process the underlying data of a
publication with tools, instead of just perusing it, Open Science requires Open
Data and Open Process on top of Open Access. In this session, we will explore
how digital editions, historically a most important part of DH, can bridge the
gap between Open Access and Open Science. Using examples of digital editions
based on the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) (TEI),
we will see how to integrate the reflection on Open Data in an edition project
as early as the conception phase, in close relationship with the theory about a
text that is, in the end, a critical edition – a theory based on data.
