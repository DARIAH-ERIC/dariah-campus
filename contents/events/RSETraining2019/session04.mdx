# Day Two: Session One

## Abstract

_From Project Idea to Requirements_

At the beginning of the session, the elements to be taken into consideration
while planning any DH project were named and discussed: a Core idea typically
evolves into a set of Research questions, then Methods to address them are
identified along with Management approaches, required Budget to support the
project and any Sustainability issues that need to be planned for in advance.

When it comes to development, in contrast to traditional project management
approaches that fix the features to be implemented in the course of the project,
Agile project management approaches, adopted by KDL, treat time and cost as
fixed variables. Instead of committing to implementing a set of features, the
team commits to delivering value within defined constraints of cost and time,
whereas features may change as the project progresses.

At pre-project stage, feasibility analysis needs to be conducted before a
project is considered viable and the rest of the life cycle initiated. In order
to prioritise requirements, KDL uses a prioritisation technique known as the
MoSCow principles, whereby, following consultation with the partners, each
required feature is assigned a status: M for “must”, S for “should”, C for “can”
and W for “will not have this time”. W requirements, although recorded by the
analyst, are considered to be outside the scope of the project, and C
requirements are low priority. In the iterative process of project development,
this prioritisation technique is used throughout the project at review meetings.

Since this training workshop was part of a specific project ("MaDiH: Mapping
Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan") with a defined core idea and a set of high
level requirements, the rest of the session focused on the project deliverables.
Producing a Proof of Concept (PoC) is one of the objectives of the project – the
notion of prototype, proving that a scaled-up version of the project can be
executed, was therefore discussed and critiqued as RSE best practice to
encourage review of and reflection on the project’s feasibility and gap
analysis.

The session further provided some examples taken from the MaDiH pre-project
stage and demonstrated KDL’s template for requirement analysis.

In addition, the applications of the “Comprehensive Archive Network” (CKAN)
system, widely used across the public sector, as proposed solution for capturing
metadata in MaDiH was discussed as an example of how an RSE solution evolves
through the KDL SDLC.
