# Day One Session Two Part One

## Abstract

_'KDL Practices: Team, Systems, Data and Models Part 1'_

The first part of the session began with the description of team roles at KDL,
aligned with a holistic vision of Research Software Engineering (RSE) career
paths plotted in a continuum from research active to research support profiles,
mappable to best practices in industry standards such as development and
management frameworks (in particular the Agile Dynamic Systems Development
Method: DSDM) and competence skills (e.g. SFIA). These roles and promotion
processes were compared and contrasted with traditional roles and promotion
processes in academia, on the one hand, and industry, on the other. Focusing on
the example of the analyst role, the range of tasks and responsibilities
inherent to the role was demonstrated.

In what followed, infrastructures and frameworks used at KDL, the lifecycle of a
typical project and its SDLC were outlined, beginning with initial contact by
the partner (i.e. an academic, a research institution or a business) through to
funding application, release and post-project hosting and maintenance. Sources
of funding and classification of projects according to size were also discussed.

KDL members of staff work on several projects in different stages of development
at the same time, and in order to manage the workflow most effectively, the team
has implemented flexible “timebox planning”, whereby tasks are planned for each
“timebox” (two-week period) and then are revised according to priority and
resources. In order to manage and document the processes effectively, KDL has
developed a set of templates for project governance documentation corresponding
to each stage of the project SDLC (such as “Terms of Reference”, “Feasibility”,
“Product Quote”, “Project Review Record” and “Service Level Agreement (SLA))”.
Simplified templates with contextual information on use can be consulted by
accessing KDL’s repository on GitHub.
