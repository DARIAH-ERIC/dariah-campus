What are the big challenges and opportunities for data-intensive research over
the next ten years? This panel discusses digital transformations in the
humanities and arts, data ethics and sovereignty, and infrastructure with
impact. It features presentations by Dr James Rose (Indigenous Studies Unit,
Melbourne School of Population and Global Health) on Data Sovereignty in a
Colonial Context: Towards an Integrated National Governance Framework for
Australia, Dr James Smithies (Director, King’s Digital Lab) on Integrating DH
into the longue durée: Research Laboratories, History, Methods.

The session was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and
3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia,
Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops
organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US
and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and
Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
