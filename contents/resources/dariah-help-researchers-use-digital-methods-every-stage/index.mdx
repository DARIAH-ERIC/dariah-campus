abstract:
  Maija Paavolainen explains the challenges of finding a 'common language' in
  the digital humanities. She finds that simply talking about this issue helps.
  Thus, experience in communicating across disciplines is a positive outcome of
  training initiatives in itself. The role of research infrastructures, she
  argues, is certainly in sharing tools and best practices. However, most
  importantly, it is also to create opportunities for people to meet and learn
  face-to-face. She explains that humanities scholars are more accustomed to
  using digital methods and tools in the initial (information gathering) and
  final (publication) stages of research. However, DARIAH, specifically, can
  help them to also use them in the core part of the research process - i.e. in
  organising, annotating, and enriching data.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
