This video features Angel D. Nieves, Professor of Africana Studies and Digital
Humanities at Hamilton College, US. In this video, Angel talks about black
spatial humanities, a field that tries to find out more about the history of
African-descended people globally and the ways which digital humanists can begin
to look at forms of institutional racism that have shaped African diaspora's
experiences. He gives examples of his 3D visualisation work that looks at the
ways in which the Apartheid government imposed restrictions to African-descended
people and how such lost histories can be effectively communicated to a wider
audience.
