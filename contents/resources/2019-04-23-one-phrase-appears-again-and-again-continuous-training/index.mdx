abstract:
  'Claire Clivaz explains how she has found that the tensions between
  disciplines in interdisciplinary work can be similar no matter what
  disciplines are being combined. Encounters between biology and computing, for
  example, can be as challenging as between humanities disciplines and
  computing. Dr Clivaz, herself, began her academic career in biblical
  manuscript studies but developed an interest in the digital humanities very
  quickly, at a time when the impact of computing was being felt in the
  humanities more widely. She explains the usefulness of the DH Course Registry
  in finding university-based, formal, DH training in Switzerland. However, she
  argues that informal opportunities to learn are crucial. One phrase that
  appears again and again in the digital humanities, she states, is: continuous
  training.'

Claire Clivaz explains how she has found that the tensions between disciplines
in interdisciplinary work can be similar no matter what disciplines are being
combined. Encounters between biology and computing can be as challenging as
between humanities disciplines and computing. Who trains new students? How do we
transfer techniques across these different 'worlds'? She began her academic
career in biblical manuscript studies but developed an interest in the digital
humanities very quickly, at a time when the impact of computing was being felt
in the humanities more widely. She explains the usefulness of the DH Course
Registry in finding university-based, formal, DH training in Switzerland.
However, she argues that informal opportunities to learn are crucial. One phrase
that appears again and again in the digital humanities, she states, is:
continuous training.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
