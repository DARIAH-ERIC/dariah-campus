This interdisciplinary course addresses how principles of textual, visual, oral,
and place-based storytelling challenge and enhance the conceptualisation,
construction and experience of digitally- created worlds connecting to
real-world places, locations, and landscapes. Applying principles of
storytelling to digital worlds across multiple situations, platforms, and
environments (built and natural) will help define and innovate the shape of
these worlds. Focused on the underlying belief that technology and narrative
create a feedback loop, with one mediating the other, this unit will be based on
iterations of ideation, conceptualisation, and prototyping to integrate critical
insights that will push on the boundaries of established beliefs and the
regulated time-space we live by, in the connectedness of datafied space and
localised place.
