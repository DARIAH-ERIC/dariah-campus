This is a record of a webinar dedicated to the phase of the Research Lifecycle
“Publish Results”. It covers several aspects related to successfully drafting
and implementing a publication and dissemination strategy taking into account
specific Research Infrastructural aspects. It first covers the basics of impact
measurement and research metrics, both from the individual researcher’s
perspective as well as the Research Infrastructure perspective since these are
strongly interlinked. It then goes into details such as repositories, new
publication types and new forms of dissemination (such as blogs or wikis) and
touches upon challenges such as data and software citation. It specifically
introduces the Impactomatrix as a tool for drafting an impact-orientated
publication and dissemination strategy.
