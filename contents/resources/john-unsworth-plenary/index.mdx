Twenty years after John Unsworth first formulated scholarly primitives as a set
of recursive and interrelated functions that form the foundations of research
activities across disciplines, theoretical frameworks or eras, his keynote is
revisiting and freshly interrogating both the notion and the scope of scholarly
primitives. In his plenary talk, he offers an honest critique of the original
2000 paper delivered at a symposium at King's College London, discussing what he
perceives as its weak points, and also reviewing each primitive in the light of
technical, social and scholarly developments since the turn of the 21st century.

John Unsworth is the University Librarian and Dean of Libraries at UVA, where he
is responsible for making yesterday’s information available tomorrow, as well as
today. He is also a Professor in the English Department. John's research is in
cyberinfrastructure for the humanities, and since 2008 that work has focused on
helping to develop the HathiTrust Research Center, which now provides
computational access to all of the 4 billion pages in the HathiTrust collection,
including the 65% that is in copyright.

The keynote was held on November 10, 2020, at the DARIAH Virtual Annual
Event 2020. https://www.dariah.eu/
