  Prof. John Unsworth delivered this keynote speech at the DARIAH Annual Event

  Scholarly Primitives that researchers in all disciplines undertake when
  conducting their investigations.

Twenty years after John Unsworth first formulated scholarly primitives as a set
of recursive and interrelated functions that form the foundations of research
activities across disciplines, theoretical frameworks or eras, his keynote is
revisiting and freshly interrogating both the notion and the scope of scholarly
primitives. To what extent does this particular set of scholarly primitives
still correspond to our understanding of what humanities scholars do on a
day-to-day basis? Has our understanding of research workflows changed over time
significantly enough to require a new classification?

John Unsworth is the University Librarian and Dean of Libraries at UVA, where he
is responsible for making yesterdayâ€™s information available tomorrow, as well as
today. He is also a Professor in the English Department. John's research is in
cyberinfrastructure for the humanities, and since 2008 that work has focused on
helping to develop the HathiTrust Research Center, which now provides
computational access to all of the 4 billion pages in the HathiTrust collection,
including the 65% that is in copyright.

The keynote was held on November 10, 2020, at the DARIAH Virtual Annual
Event 2020. https://www.dariah.eu/
