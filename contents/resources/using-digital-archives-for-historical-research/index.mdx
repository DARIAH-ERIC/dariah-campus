This video is of ‘Using Digital Archives for Historical Research’, the **first**
webinar in a three-part public lecture series on using digital archives for
academic research hosted by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) and aimed
primarily at early career researchers.

Access to brick-and-mortar archives has been limited due to COVID-19
restrictions, creating challenges for humanities researchers that rely on
archival materials for their research. This webinar aims to showcase some of the
rich research resources contained in digital archival collections.

Featured digital collections in the first webinar include:

- Beyond 2022: This archival initiative aims to restore – as far as possible –
  the collections lost in the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland
  in 1922, at the outbreak of the Irish Civil War.

- The Inspiring Ireland Project - National Museum of Ireland: This collection
  contains a selection of cultural heritage objects from the National Museum of
  Ireland presented as part of the Inspiring Ireland project, which features a
  series of exhibitions containing cultural artefacts related to the events
  of 1916.

- Bureau of Military History (1913-1921): The Bureau of Military History
  Collection, 1913-1921 (BMH) is a collection of 1,773 witness statements; 334
  sets of contemporary documents; 42 sets of photographs, and 13 voice
  recordings that were collected by the State between 1947 and 1957, in order to
  gather primary source material for the revolutionary period in Ireland from
  1913 to 1921.

- Dublin City Library and Archive (DCLA), Fáilte Ireland Tourism Photographic
  Collection and Jacob's Biscuit Factory Archive: These collections, spanning
  from the 1890s to the early 2000s, comprise almost 20,00 images between them
  and growing.

## Learning Outcomes

After watching this webinar, early career researchers will be familiar with some
of the digital archival collections that can be explored to advance historical
research.
