abstract:
  Martin Lhoták first began digital research in an IT department, which formed
  his connection with information systems and databases, as well as the
  development of software tools and the digital humanities. Unlike many
  librarians, he does not have a humanist background, but instead a technical
  education, so finds that he speaks differently from the humanities scholars he
  works with. However he finds interactions with these scholars interesting and
  inspiring. Regarding training, he argues that being technically knowledgeable
  - though not necessarily a programmer themselves - is essential for doing
  research in the digital humanities.

Martin Lhoták first began digital research in an IT department, which formed his
connection with information systems and databases, as well as the development of
software tools and the digital humanities. Unlike many librarians, he does not
have a humanist background, but instead a technical education, so finds that he
speaks differently from the humanities scholars he works with. However he finds
interactions with these scholars interesting and inspiring. Regarding training,
he argues that being technically knowledgeable - though not necessarily a
programmer themselves - is essential for doing research in the digital
humanities.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
