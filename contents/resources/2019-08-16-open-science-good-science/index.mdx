abstract:
  "In this lecture, Jon Tennant argues that 'Open Science' is 'good science',
  because it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and public good. However,
  he argues, researchers are not rewarded for doing good science. Tennant asks:
  'how can we all work together to kick-start a new culture of open scientific
  practices, without putting our best and brightest at risk? How do we want
  people in the future to see this pivotal time in the history of science?' He
  challenges the audience to answer the question: 'which side do you want to be
  on?'"
