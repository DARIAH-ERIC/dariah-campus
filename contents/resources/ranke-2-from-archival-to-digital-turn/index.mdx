abstract:
  Have you ever reflected on the origin and authenticity of an historical source
  that you retrieved on the web? This lesson, published on the teaching platform
  for digital source criticism Ranke2, offers insights into how the practice of
  applying source criticism has been affected by the digital turn. What are the
  new questions that historians should ask to digitised and digital born
  historical sources and what new skills should they master to be able to answer
  these questions?

The objective of this lesson is to teach students how the digital turn has
affected the method of applying source criticism to a historical source. Source
criticism comes down to asking questions about the origin, authenticity and
informational and artefactual value of a source. When applying it to digital
content an additional layer of alterations and transformations has to be
identified and described. This lesson teaches learners the difference between
attributing meaning to an artefact during its creation, its preservation and its
digitisation. The assignments can be used to put this into practice with various
types of data and in different digital environments.

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen, that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The premise of the lesson _From the Archival to the Digital turn_ available on
the [Ranke.2 platform](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/) is that
historians of the 21st century need to have a basic understanding of the process
of digitisation, of the creation of digital born sources and of the algorithms
that drive search engines.
