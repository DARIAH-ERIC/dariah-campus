This tutorial explains the fundamentals of the DARIAH-DE Publikator, a tool
which allows you to prepare, manage, and finally import your collections into
the DARIAH-DE Repository using your favourite internet browser. The Repository
provides the ability to store research data and enrich them with metadata.
Through the use of persistent identifiers, a permanent machine-readable
reference is ensured and findable via a generic search.

Likewise, the repository makes it possible to store data collections sustainably
and securely. With the help of the DARIAH-DE Publikator, research data can
easily be imported into the DARIAH-DE Repository via a graphical user interface
and tagged with metadata. These research data can be described as a collection
in the DARIAH-DE Collection Registry and are then identified in the DARIAH-DE
Generic Search.

The tutorial is conveniently divided into several sections. The user guides give
step-by-step instructions on how to use the DARIAH-DE Publikator. This is
presented in three parts: Collections, Log in with a DARIAH-DE Account or with a
Federation Account, and Publishing with the DARIAH-DE Publikator. The technical
documentation explains in detail how the DARIAH-DE Publikator works by
presenting its service APIs.
