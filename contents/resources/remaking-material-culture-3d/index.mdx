This course is designed to develop your knowledge of the theory and practice of
digitising material culture by producing computer generated and printed 3D
models. Technologies and methods for recording tangible cultural heritage,
including artefacts, buildings, and landscapes are covered, placing particular
emphasis on the field of computational imaging; a field in computer science that
studies the computational extraction of information from digital photographs and
has democratised the process of capturing, preserving, disseminating, and
promoting heritage. 3D digitisation and 3D printing will be presented both
theoretically and practically, discussing the history and the state-of-the-art,
best practices and protocols, and characteristic applications from various
fields.
