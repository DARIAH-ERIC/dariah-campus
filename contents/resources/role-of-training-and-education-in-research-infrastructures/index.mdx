DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow DARIAHns and colleagues from
prospective DARIAH countries about their own educational backgrounds and the
role of training and education in digital research infrastructures. The
interviews show that there is no single educational trajectory which produces DH
scholars. The diversity of our backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our
field.
