In this video, Jennifer Edmond gives us insights into her background in critical
theory approaches and German literary history, through a spell in technical
support and research strategy in the humanities, and how this has impacted her
work in DARIAH. She talks about the importance of pushing beyond the foundations
of your academic training to do new things in the humanities. How can the system
vaildate this kind of groundbreaking research, and make it possible for early
career researchers to make the leap? She explains the unique role of DARIAH in
this process.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
