As part of the DARIAH In-House Webinar sessions in the Autumn of 2020, the
'Friday Frontiers' programme included a presentation on Post-Publication Peer
Review (PPPR) from former President of the DARIAH Board of Directors, Laurent
Romary. Laurent, who is based at INRIA in France, gave a 45 minute presentation
that outlined the steps that have brought scholars to look to PPPR, the benefits
and risks associated with it, and how digital humanities scholars can engage
with the development of PPPR to ensure sustainable, trusted and open science.

The DARIAH In-House Webinar series 'Friday Frontiers' was launched in October
2020 in order to provide an opportunity for the DARIAH community to improve
their skills and learn about new and developing techniques and issues within the
digital arts and humanities landscape.
