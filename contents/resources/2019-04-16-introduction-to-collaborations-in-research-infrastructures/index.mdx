Is humanities research collaborative? Some would say that with our traditions of
independent research and single authorship, it is not. This is not really true
for any humanist, however, as collaboration does occur within classrooms,
on-line communities, and within disciplinary networks. For the digital
humanities, this is even more the case, as the hybridity of our methods require
us to work together. Very few digital humanists can master entirely on their own
the domain, information and software challenges their approach presents, and so
we tend to work together.

By the end of this module you should be able to: 1) Understand what is meant by
collaboration in humanities research, 2) Be aware of how this model impacts upon
the development of digital humanities, and digital humanities research
infrastructures.
