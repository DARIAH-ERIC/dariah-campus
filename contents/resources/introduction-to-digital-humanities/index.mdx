This course brings together established and emerging scholars from different
parts of the world, fields and disciplines, theoretical and methodological
traditions, who demonstrate the diversity of Digital Humanities by critically
approaching schools of thought, methods, tools, standards, projects, and
teaching practices in a series of videos. At present, we have two strands: one
that addresses the question What is Digital Humanities under the title: ‘My
Digital Humanities’; and a second entitled ‘Digital Humanities in Practice’
which goes into more depth theoretically or methodologically, or focuses on
disciplinary practice, standards or approaches.

All videos include metadata about the speakers, the contributors, and the
production, as well as a list of references for those who would like to delve
into the various topics. Each video is also tagged using terms from the NeDiMAH
Methods Ontology (NeMO), a CIDOC-CRM compliant ontological model which
explicitly maps out the interplay of factors of agency (actors and goals),
process (activities and methods) and resources (information resources, tools,
concepts) in Digital Humanities scholarly processes.
