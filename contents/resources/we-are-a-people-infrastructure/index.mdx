In this video, Laurent Romary gives his perspective on training and education in
research infrastructures. He reveals how his engineering background taught him
precision in analysing computer concepts, and how this has impacted on his role
in a humanities research infrastructure. He proceeds to focus on DARIAH's role
as a 'people infrastructure' and the importance of training in that. He
considers the importance of adaptability of training to learners from differents
scholarly communities and competence levels.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
