As part of the DARIAH-EU In House Webinar series, 'Friday Frontiers', Dr. Jonny
Johnston and Kevin O'Connor from Trinity College Dublin (TCD) hosted a webinar
focused on ‘Flipped Classroom’ methodologies in December 2020. Jonny (Academic
Practice) and Kevin (IT Services) led a highly interactive session that
discussed the theory and practice of the flipped classroom, demonstrating some
of the techniques associated with it that can be used to digitally enhance
teaching and learning.

**Note:** This video shows extracts from a live presentation that included a lot
of interaction among the participants. It has been edited to remove gaps between
and during in-webinar exercises and to remove any discussion that took part
during the session to ensure participant confidentiality.
