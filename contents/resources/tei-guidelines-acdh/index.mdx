The first ACDH-CH lecture of 2020 took place online! We made the best of the
situation and continued the series online this year with Laurent Romary, Inria
(France), introducing us to the topic “TEI guidelines: born to be open”.

Open science has never been so high on the research agendas, and this is true in
all fields, ranging from so-called hard sciences to the humanities. In this
respect, those who have been dealing with the TEI guidelines for years, whether
as users or designers of the standard, have experienced an environment which has
always been open by construction and fostering openness for projects based upon
its principles.

In the ACDH-CH lecture 6.1 Laurent Romary outlined the main issues related to
open science in the current scholarly landscape, whether political or technical.
The presentation has shown the various aspects where the TEI environment has
been seminal in setting up an open agenda that may enlightened the humanities at
large in terms of good practices, for, e.g., managing, documenting or
disseminating scholarly sources and methods.
