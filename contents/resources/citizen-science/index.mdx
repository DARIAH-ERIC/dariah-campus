This module looks at the variety of practices within ‘citizen science’, how you
as a humanist might get started working with them, what issues you might be wary
of along the way and how Research Infrastructures can potentially help you.

By the end of this module, you should be able to: Recognise and define common
approaches to incorporating citizen science into research projects in the arts
and humanities; be aware of strategies and tools for managing citizen input to
research; and recognise some of the possible challenges in such projects and be
equipped to manage them.
