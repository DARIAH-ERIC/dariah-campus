Riccardo Pozzo is chair of the History of Philosophy at University of Rome Tor
Vergata and chair of the DARIAH Scientific Board. The focus of his keynote is on
the notion of cultural innovation, which requires adapting the process of
co-creation. Processes and outcomes of cultural innovation are contrasted
against other forms of innovation, while showing their operationalisation in
some empirical case studies.

The keynote was recorded at the DESIR Final Event, in November 2019, in Zagreb,
Croatia. The event was organised in the framework of the Horizon 2020 funded
project DESIR (DARIAH ERIC Sustainability Refined).
