Riccardo Pozzo is chair of the History of Philosophy at University of Rome Tor
Vergata and chair of the DARIAH Scientific Board. The focus of his keynote is on
the introduction of the notion of cultural innovation, which requires adapting
the process of co-creation. The dimension of cultural innovation is contrasted
against other forms of innovation, attempting to point out processes and
outcomes of cultural innovation while showing their operationalisation in some
empirical case studies.

The keynote was recorded at the DESIR Final Event, in November 2019, in Zagreb,
Croatia. The event was organised in the framework of the Horizon 2020 funded
project DESIR (DARIAH ERIC Sustainability Refined).
