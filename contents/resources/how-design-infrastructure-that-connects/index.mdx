How do we design infrastructure that connects? This panel discusses
collaborative platforms, partnerships between research and cultural sectors, and
libraries as labs. It features presentations by Seb Chan — Chief Experience
Officer, Australian Centre for the Moving Image and Dr Marie-Louise Ayres —
Director General, National Library of Australia.

The session was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and
3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia,
Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops
organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US
and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and
Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
