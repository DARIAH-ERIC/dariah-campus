In this lecture, Sally Chambers, Digital Humanities Research Coordinator at the
Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities outlines how DARIAH as a Research
Infrastructure works within Europe to connect with arts and humanities
researchers. She elaborates on how such a European Research Infrastructure could
start to work more widely internationally.

This presentation was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit
and 3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of
Australia, Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of
three-day workshops organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018
and 2019, in the US and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the
DARIAH community and Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international
context.
