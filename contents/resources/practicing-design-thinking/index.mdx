Design thinking is much less about knowing and much more about doing. Donald
Schön, in his groundbreaking work on design (1984, 1992), demonstrated that
knowing is in the activity of designing, and that the two cannot be separated.
The focus in this course is on the practical aspects of design thinking,
offering the tools and methods for students and researchers to apply the
principles of design thinking when facing problems of their own. Note that the
course
[Introduction to Design Thinking and Maker Culture](/resource/introduction-to-design-thinking-and-maker-culture)
offers extensive information on design thinking and makers culture as well. It
offers most of all information on the ‘what’ and ‘why’. This course focuses
above all on the ‘how’.
