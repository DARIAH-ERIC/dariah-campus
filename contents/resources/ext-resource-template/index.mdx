Design thinking: even though the name suggest otherwise, it is much less about
knowing and much more about doing. In Donald Schön's groundbreaking work on
design (1984, 1992) he demonstrated that knowing is in the activity of
designing, it cannot be separated. This course is designed to help students and
professionals to apply design thinking and in this course you will discover that
design thinking is learning what is needed by creating it. The focus in this
course is on doing design thinking, offering the tools and methods for students
and researchers to conduct design thinking to deal with a (wicked) problem they
face. Note that the course: Design thinking & Maker culture offers extensive
information on design thinking and makers culture as well. It offers most of all
information on the what and why. This course 'Practicing Design Thinking &
Making' focuses above all on the ‘how’.
