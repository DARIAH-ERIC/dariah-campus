This is a record of a webinar providing a theoretical basis for a general
understanding of the digital and infrastructural turn in the (Digital)
Humanities and Cultural Heritage along with theoretical and critical reflections
around the topic: Which opportunities and challenges do Cultural Heritage and
Digital Humanities Research Infrastructures offer for research(ers)?

The webinar further explains how different stakeholders can engage with Research
Infrastructures (community engagement and user engagement). Examples are
research communities and networks, transnational digital collections, thematic
working groups, overarching organisations (ERIC platforms, the Research Data
Alliance), conferences and workshops, Transnational Access, Research
Infrastructures in Academic Curricula. As a general introductory webinar it also
touches on some aspects of the other webinars in the PARTHENOS Webinar Series
including a short introduction of the research lifecycle. This webinar features
“teasers” from several Research Infrastructures, such as short introduction
videos or webcontent).
