abstract:
  This is a record of a webinar dedicated to the phase of the research life
  cycle “Plan Research Project”. It first introduces the participants to an
  understanding of the advantages and practicalities of research collaboration
  in and with Research infrastructures. It then dives into details of project
  planning, touches upon the basics of the FAIR principles, and focuses
  especially on the importance of using standards in Digital Humanities and
  Cultural Heritage research and how to identify relevant standards for the
  participants’ own research. This webinar gives an introduction to the
  Standards Survival Kit that is developed within PARTHENOS. It also cross-links
  to other materials developed within PARTHENOS and by the PARTHENOS Cluster
  Partners.
