For a computer scientist, collaborating with humanists can be a challenging, interesting, and productive experience. It can also seed ideas and insights with long-term implications for visualization research. In this talk, visualization designer Miriah Meyer reflects on a collaboration with poetry scholars that impacted her own research thinking in deep and disruptive ways. She describes learning that came out of this digital humanities project through the lens of several recent studies, each with core ideas that trace back to work with poetry scholars.
