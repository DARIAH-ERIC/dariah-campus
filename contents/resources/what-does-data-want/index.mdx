abstract:
  'Many academic disciplines use data science to analyze contemporary culture.
  The question posed by Lev Manovich in this lecture is: shall we continue to
  aggregate big cultural data and reduce it to a small set of patterns? Or shall
  we refuse this dominant paradigm instead and focus on diversity, variability
  and differences (including tiny ones), i.e., work on big cultural data without
  aggregation and with attention to what is infrequent and outliers?'

Many academic disciplines use data science to analyze contemporary culture. The
question posed by Lev Manovich in this lecture is: shall we continue to
aggregate big cultural data and reduce it to a small set of patterns? Or shall
we refuse this dominant paradigm instead and focus on diversity, variability and
differences (including tiny ones), i.e., work on big cultural data without
aggregation and with attention to what is infrequent and outliers?

Dr. Lev Manovich is a Professor of Computer Science at The Graduate Center,
CUNY, and a Director of the Cultural Analytics Lab that pioneered analysis of
visual culture using computational methods. Manovich is the author and editor of
13 books including "AI Aesthetics", "Theories of Software Culture", "Instagram
and Contemporary Image", "Software Takes Command", "Soft Cinema: Navigating the
Database" and "The Language of New Media" which was described as "the most
suggestive and broad ranging media history since Marshall McLuhan".
