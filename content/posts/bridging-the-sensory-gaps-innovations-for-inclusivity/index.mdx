With around 15% of the global population experiencing some form of disability, have we truly considered what ‘inclusion’ and ‘equal opportunity’ means for all?  This talk confronts the reality that most spaces, technologies, and innovations are predominantly designed for individuals with all senses and functionalities intact.  How would you as a person with deafblindness navigate the world – a world filled with navigation and mobility challenges, inaccessible information, and technologies that rely on the senses of sight and hearing?  In this talk, Nasrine Olson (PhD, Associate Professor) introduces the idea behind the formation of the Centre for Inclusive Studies at University of Borås and presents a few projects that have explored ways in which technology can be leveraged to level the playing field. 

### About the Speaker 

Nasrine Olson is an Associate Professor in the field of Library and Information Science at SSLIS, University of Borås, Sweden. Core research interests relate to issues of power and the relationships in day-to-day action, and broader societal structures. In more recent years her focus has been on the societal implication of ICTs and information practices that enable or hinder the potential for equal opportunity for all. She has also been instrumental in creating research environments that promote, and lead to, improved inclusive technologies and environments by coordinating projects such as EU-funded projects [MuseIT](https://www.muse-it.eu/) (2022-2025) and [SUITCEYES](https://suitceyes.eu/) (2018-2021). Nasrine is also the director of an interdisciplinary research centre called [INCLUDE](https://www.hb.se/en/research/research-portal/centres/include--centre-for-inclusive-studies/) – Centre for Inclusive Studies, where through critical examination the ideology of normal, the unequal treatments of societal members is explored.
