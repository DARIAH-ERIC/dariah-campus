Georeferencing is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to a scanned map or raster image. Many historians are now georeferencing historical maps to study how places have changed over time. After georeferencing a historic map, you may want to display it online to share your research or tell a story. In this lesson, we will show you how to share a georeferenced map online using StoryMap JS, an interactive web-based mapping platform. StoryMap JS is an open-source tool from Knight Lab at Northwestern University, which allows you to integrate historical and contemporary maps into interactive stories.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Customize and share a georeferenced map online using StoryMap JS, an interactive web-based mapping platform
- Integrate historical and contemporary maps into interactive stories
