This resource aims to support better understanding of multidimensional media available over the web which might serve various educational, research, as well as storytelling and audience engagement processes.  Learners will engage in methods for managing media in a way which promotes the FAIR principles, and be introduced to the concept of a Virtual Research Environment to support retrieval and curation of multidimensional data for storytelling via interoperable frameworks.



## **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this course, learners will:

- Define the different types of multidimensional media.
- Recognise the advantages of delivering and retrieving multidimensional content over the web via URLs and PIDs.
- Reflect on FAIR and CARE principles and their application on digital heritage research data.
- Understand the usefulness of Virtual Research Environments (VRE) and deploy VREs to support retrieval and curation of multidimensional data for storytelling via interoperable frameworks.
