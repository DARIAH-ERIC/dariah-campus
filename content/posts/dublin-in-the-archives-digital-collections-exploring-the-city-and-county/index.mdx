This recording is of 'Dublin in the Archives: Digital collections exploring the city and county' a webinar hosted by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) for Culture Night in September 2021.

Digital archives are bursting with collections relating to Dublin's past and present. They trace the boundaries and geography of the city and the social, cultural, and business life of Dubliners through its centuries of habitation. This webinar brings together the content creators of these exceptional collections as well as the historians, geographers, and curators of digitised records to showcase what Dublin city and county material is available online and in digital format. The webinar shows how these digital collections can be used together to give us a multi-dimensional view of Dublin's past and present.

The webinar includes a lively discussion of archival collections containing rich material ranging from 'ghost signs' that illustrate the hidden history of Dublin's commercial past, to historical collections on key events in our shared history like the 1916 Rising, to community-based films that showcase the contemporary social history of the city, and to photographs that provide insight into the fascinating heritage of communities like the Dublin Port docklands.

The event is chaired by Deputy City Librarian at Dublin City Library and Archive (DCLA), Brendan Teeling. DCLA holds a remarkable range of digital collections within the DRI that both document and illuminate the history of Dublin over the last eight centuries.
