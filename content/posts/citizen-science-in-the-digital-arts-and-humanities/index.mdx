This module looks at the variety of practices within ‘citizen science’, how you as a humanist might get started working with them, what issues you might be wary of along the way and how Research Infrastructures can potentially help you.

By the end of this module, you should be able to: Recognise and define common approaches to incorporating citizen science into research projects in the arts and humanities; be aware of strategies and tools for managing citizen input to research; and recognise some of the possible challenges in such projects and be equipped to manage them.
