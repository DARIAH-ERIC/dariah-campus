## Introduction

Prompt engineering is a critical skill to develop when working with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, especially when interacting with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It involves crafting effective and precise input prompts to elicit the desired output from an AI model. This skill is essential in various fields, including the digital humanities, where researchers and professionals leverage AI to explore, analyze, and interpret cultural, historical, and archaeological data.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this training resource, learners should be able to:

- Understand a wide array of prompt engineering techniques useful in text to text and text to image AI tools
- Practice discernment in knowing when to use each method and why
- Identify examples of each technique covered in this resource
- Recall a wide range of fields in which AI is currently being applied
- Discuss the benefits, drawbacks and limitations of applied AI using examples

## What are ‘Prompts’ and How to Use Them?

While Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool, it's essential to remember that AI-generated outputs require careful review and corroboration. AI models can produce inaccurate or misleading information, especially if prompts are ambiguous or lack specificity. Users should be critical and evaluate the outputs, cross-referencing them against reliable sources. Trusting AI outputs without proper scrutiny can lead to the propagation of errors or misinterpretations in research and analysis.

Before we start this module in earnest, let’s take a quick look at how we can use AI to generate text or images using ‘prompts’.  A ‘prompt’ is a line of text that instructs the text or image generate as to what you want it to produce.  Prompts can be entered into various AI-driven platforms, including:

- Text-based AI systems: Such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Anthropic's Claude or Google's Gemini, where prompts guide the model to generate responses.
- AI-driven analysis tools: Used in text mining, natural language processing, or image recognition software.
- Educational and research platforms: Like digital humanities tools and databases integrated with AI capabilities.

Prompt engineering allows for more precise and meaningful interactions with AI tools, enhancing research and educational outcomes. By refining prompts, users can ensure that the AI provides responses that are both relevant and insightful. The following are examples of queries with simple prompts and corrected, more specific prompts.

#### Example 1: Artifact Description

Simple Prompt: "Describe "X" artifact."

Well-Engineered Prompt: "Describe the main features, historical significance, and possible cultural context of a Roman pottery fragment dated around 200 AD found in a burial site."

Why it's better: The good prompt is more specific, guiding the AI to provide detailed information relevant to the context, rather than a vague or general description.

#### Example 2: Site Analysis

Simple Prompt: "Tell me about "X" archaeological site."

Well-Engineered Prompt: "Provide a detailed analysis of the architectural structure and religious significance of the temple found at the archaeological site in Luxor, Egypt, dating back to the 18th Dynasty."

Why it's better: This prompt specifies the location, historical period, and aspects of the site to focus on, leading to a more accurate and relevant response.

In the next section, we will take a closer look at the methods of prompt engineering in text-to-text AI. 



## Introduction to Prompt Engineering in Text-to-Text AI

In the broad landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), text-to-text AI stands out for its ability to process and generate human-like text. Unlike other AI types, which might focus on visual or auditory processing, text-to-text AI excels in understanding and producing written language, making it particularly useful in applications like chatbots, content creation, and language translation.

Prompt engineering is a critical skill for effectively utilizing text-to-text AI. It involves crafting input prompts that guide the AI to produce the desired output. This is not just about what you ask, but how you ask it. The quality of the AI's response often hinges on the clarity, structure, and specificity of the prompt.

As we discuss various various prompt engineering methods, remember, the goal is to communicate with the AI as effectively as possible. Each method has its unique application and context, helping you unlock the full potential of AI in humanities research and beyond. Understanding these techniques will enable you to tailor AI responses to your specific needs, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of your interactions with AI systems.
