The goal of this tutorial is to introduce learners to the challenges posed by the increasing development and use of artificial intelligence. It does so through an introduction to the potential risks which may be caused by continued development, an interdisciplinary look at the current state of Artificial Intelligence's progress and case studies of real-world examples detailing the complexities of Artificial Intelligence which have already confronted society across legal and ethical fields.

### L﻿earning Outcomes

After completing this training resource, learners should be able to:

- think critically about both the benefits and drawbacks of the implementation of Artificial Intelligence in society
- s﻿eparate the current state of the complexities of Artificial Intelligence from the potential future risks
- e﻿xplore and gain familiarity with real world examples of issues surrounding Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, known as AI, has long presented as a theoretical contradiction; some say it will have the power to propel us into a world of greater accuracy, efficiency, ease, and provide us with capabilities and outputs beyond our wildest imagination.  Others speak of the fears instilled by the power and potential held by AI. Will it replace us? Will it turn on us? Will it destroy society?  Both its champions and its detractors can agree on one thing. The development and implementation of AI will change our lives and our world.  It is up to us to determine how that change will present itself. 

A﻿s we move from simple AI assistants like Siri and Alexa who we rely upon to wake us up and tell us the weather in the morning towards more capable and controversial forms of AI like chat gpt, which can compose full film scripts and pen essays for University courses at the touch of a button, the public is in the throes of determining the terms of its relationship with a formidable and enduring companion. 

I﻿n such a pivotal moment, it is crucial for the public to become and remain informed, not only on how AI impacts our own field, our research topic or our family and friends, but also on a broader philosophical scale as well as in fields we may never consider which may end up touching us all.  

I﻿n order to make more informed and unified decisions which guide the direction of AI as a part of our future, we must have an awareness of where development stands and where it may progress towards in fields including healthcare, criminal justice, economics, surveillance, governance, education, warfare, intellectual property, logistics and more.  

T﻿his tutorial provides an organized overview and examples of the most thought provoking and pressing challenges facing us today as we learn, debate and help define what a future looks like with AI. 

## Ethical Issues

![](images/ai1.jpg)

A﻿I introduces us to a litany of debates between what is right and wrong in its use. It makes us question our humanity, weigh progress against protections and pre-determine outcomes to a number of autonomous quandaries which force us to confront our own morality and values. 

T﻿he great AI debate is a larger prism for discussions of the society we would like to build.  When it comes to AI in warfare or medicine or self driving vehicles, we are plainly confronted with the infamous "trolley problem"  of Philosophy 101 in real life. If an AI tool is going to be making decisions which could impact us corporeally, we must program the desired outcome, forcing us to grapple with pre-determining impossible choices like choosing the life of either the passengers or a pedestrian in a cross walk.  

I﻿t is imperative to open our minds to the ethical issues we face with the development in AI so that we may debate, explore and formulate our own informed opinions on the society we would like to create with the choices being made during this time.  As such, the following section provides an introduction to both the potential risks as well as the current state of AI and ethics. Learners should challenge themselves to draw connections between the current states and the potential risks that are presented in this tutorial.  What may be done to avoid the risks noted here? What are positive outcomes we may help guide AI towards with proper regulation of development?

### Potential Risks

**Bias and Fairness:** Artificial Intelligence algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the Artificial Intelligence system may perpetuate or even amplify existing social inequalities. For example, biased facial recognition systems might misidentify certain racial or ethnic groups more frequently.

**Privacy and Surveillance:** Artificial Intelligence systems can process vast amounts of personal data, potentially leading to privacy infringements. As Artificial Intelligence becomes more sophisticated, there's an increased risk of surveillance, unauthorized access, and misuse of personal information.
