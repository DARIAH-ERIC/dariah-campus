This podcast produced by virtualculture.ch features a conversation between Jane Haller, president of the Digitales Schaudepot, and Esaù Dozio, curator at the Antikenmuseum Basel.  In it they discuss the processes of curating a special exhibition; the perceived advantages and disadvantages between physical and digital exhibitions both in terms of management and curation, and the impact both might have on the public; and what mistakes, missteps and challenges were faced along the way.

As a winning project of the DARIAH Thematic Funding Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD). We conducted interviews to capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, and turned the interviews into podcasts for broadcast.
