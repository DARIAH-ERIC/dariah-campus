  Jane Haller, a sociologist, digital project manager, and president of the
  Digitales Schaudepot, is in conversation with Esaù Dozio. Esaù has a
  background in classical archeology and is responsible for special exhibitions
  and for the vase collection, he works as a curator at the Antikenmuseum Basel.


  As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) it is intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoiding unwanted missteps. Keep in mind that each project is distinct and may necessitate alternative measures.


  To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted interviews. Here you find the talk with Esaù Dozio (Background in classical archeology, responsible for special exhibitions and for the vase collection, works as a curator at the Antikenmuseum Basel).
