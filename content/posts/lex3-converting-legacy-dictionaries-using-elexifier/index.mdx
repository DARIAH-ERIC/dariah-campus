This course introduces Elexifier, a cloud-based dictionary service for the conversion of legacy XML and PDF dictionaries into a shared data format based on the ELEXIS Data Model. 

## Learning Outcomes:

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- convert XML or PDF dictionaries into TEI-compliant XML in line with the specification described in the ELEXIS Data Model.



## Prerequisites

This course requires basic knowledge of XML, which can be acquired from the course Capturing, Modeling and Transforming Lexical Data: An Introduction. Especially the part on Modeling lexicographic data (with XML) is essential. In addition to this, we recommend doing the course Extracting Lexical Data: XPath for Dictionary Nerds if you want to grasp the finer details of defining transformation in Elexifier. For transforming PDF dictionaries, basic knowledge of Lexonomy is recommended. For this, check out the course Lexonomy: Mastering the ELEXIS Dictionary Writing System. Finally, if you want to learn more about the Dictionary Matrix, we suggest you do the course Mastering LEX1: The Dictionary Matrix.
