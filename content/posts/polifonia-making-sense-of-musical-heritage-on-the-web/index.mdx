abstract: Polifonia is a H2020 project that aims at harmonising diverse
  information sources in the landscape of musical heritage and scholarship. The
  challenges are many, from data management, to knowledge organisation and
  dissemination barriers. In this talk, an ontology driven strategy to organise,
  share, and interact with the wealth of music data on the web, is presented.
  This include solutions to engage with scholars and lay persons, with an
  emphasis on data visualisation and storytelling.
