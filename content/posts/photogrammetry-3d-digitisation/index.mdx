This resource is an introduction to the photogrammetry technique to capture visual data about cultural heritage assets and produce associated 3D models. Photogrammetry is a technique also known as Structure from Motion (SfM). Both terms are used to refer to the computing process of estimating the 3D structure of a scene from a set of 2D raster images. A photogrammetry software receives as an input a set of raster images of an object or environment and outputs a 3D model.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this course, learners will:

- Be able to explain the basics of photogrammetry, including practical aspects of photogrammetric acquisition projects.
- Determine which objects and environments are suitable for this technique.
- Design the best setup and strategy to photograph objects for photogrammetry.
- Use software to process visual data and output a 3D model.
