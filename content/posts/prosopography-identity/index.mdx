## Introduction

This resource covers the Theory of Identity within Prosopography. It looks into characteristics like roles, titles, ages, and presence at events. This resource will cover ethnicity, sexuality, gender, religion and beyond. These aspects are critical in understanding the multi-dimensional identities of historical individuals and how these identities were perceived and recorded.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this resource, learners should be able to:

- Determine the importance and organizational impact of different characteristics of identities as well as their fluidity over time. Learners will also be equipped to critically analyze historical sources and identify how identities are constructed and represented. 

## Data Collection Problems:

### Identity

Theory of Identity is one of the most complex areas for prosopographers to deal with in their work. Characteristics like roles, titles, ages, and presence at events may be disputed between texts, but ultimately can be assumed to have a “correct” answer, even if we will never know what it is. It’s essential to approach these characteristics with a critical eye, understanding that historical records may contain biases and inaccuracies. It’s uncontroversial to model the idea that people were only born once, could only be in one place at any given time, or that they either had or did not have a particular titled job. Identities as a category are very different: they are fluid, multi-layered, subject to interpretation and fluctuations over time. This fluidity makes it challenging to create a definitive model of identity, requiring a nuanced and flexible approach. It’s important therefore to know what you’re handling and how your database’s model of identity works.

Types of identity can include:  

**Ethnicity** – Possibly the most obviously complex form of identity, constructed of a wide range of linguistic, cultural, that are heavily subject to change over time. Ethnicity can encompass language, cultural practices, and self-identification, all of which may evolve across generations.

**Nationality** – In modern contexts, with defined legal ideas of citizenship to a particular state, this can sometimes be treated as clear, but in most historical contexts formal definitions of this kind did not necessarily exist, and nationality does not necessarily go with legal status neatly: for example, it would be common to refer to people made stateless by withdrawal of citizenship by their original nationality. This also blurs heavily into ethnicity. Historical notions of nationality were often fluid and could change based on political and social circumstances. 

**Gender** – More complex than it often looks. The mostly binary system of understanding gender used often in Europe is frequently inadequate due to the wide actual range of social roles and phenotypic variations on which it is based and contains numerous caveats and additional groups (for example eunuchs in Byzantium were referred to by male pronouns but it has been argued that they culturally effectively formed a third gender grouping). A binary understanding is not the norm everywhere in the world either, and many culture have traditions of other gender identities existing. Understanding gender in historical contexts requires recognizing these diverse roles and identities. 

**Sexuality** – like gender, understood in very different ways at different times by different peoples. Whilst modern western societies’ language tends to take categories according to gender (homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual), other and past societies could take categorisations according to sexual dominance/respective roles (as occurs in Ancient Greek understandings of what we might think of as homosexual behaviour), or simply according to a normative/non-normative distinction. The interpretation of sexuality can vary widely, influenced by cultural, social, and religious norms. 

**Religion** – it may seem like someone’s religious affiliation should be comparatively straightforward. However, that can depend in what depth you want to model it, and even then it’s not always clear – for example, consider various early Christian heresies, which the established church would consider to not be Christian but considered themselves to be the only correct way of doing Christianity. Or someone who just mixed up liturgical practices from multiple faith traditions in an idiosyncratic way. The boundaries aren’t as clear as they seem. Religious identity can be layered and complex, often intersecting with other aspects of identity.

Remember that whether and what typology you adopt is up to you and depends what’s important for your material. For example, in my medieval dataset I don’t make an “Ethnic” and “National” distinction – it doesn’t really make sense for the time period, nor would I be able to differentiate from the sources which category a given term should go in.  

#### Identity is fluid. 

It changes over time, and its constituent parts can also change. When a medieval Byzantine text refers to “Romaioi” – Romans – they generally mean mostly Greekspeaking Byzantines under the rule of the Byzantine Emperor. This would be rather surprising to a Republican-era ancient Roman, especially if you told them that the medieval “Romaioi” did not have Rome as their capital and indeed did not even control the city. This is a very large shift, but smaller ones are possible too: a dress code that identifies a certain cultural group in one decade might not do so twenty years later. In Georgia, one of the classic pieces of national dress is the Chokha coat – but the modern look of it is probably seventeenth century at the earliest, as the chest decorations developed from an inbuilt bandolier putting them after the widespread use of firearms.

What we think of as the distinctive signs of an identity are very subject to change over time.  Identity can appear from different perspectives. If a commander of the Georgian armies in the medieval period was of Armenian extraction, the Georgian material might well refer to him as an Armenian. Arabic or Persian histories, on the other hand, wouldn’t likely care as much about the differentiation between Christian groups and would refer to him as a Georgian. Neither identification is wrong: it’s just a matter of what the notable aspect is to any given onlooker.  

Identity is situational. Much of identity is performed – which bits of who you are go on show, and how people react to them depends on your situation. 

#### Layered Identities

People can have regional, national, and international identities, multiple national identities, can follow parts of multiple religions at once, and so on. Identity can never just be a “select one from the dropdown menu” question, because such distinctions break down fast. We can illustrate the situationality of identity with me as an example. A bunch of my identities are that I am from Norfolk, from East Anglia, from England, from Britain, and from Europe. When I’m in Vienna, the fact that I self-consciously have a European identity is fairly irrelevant – most people here do. What’s noteworthy about me in this situation is that I’m British/English, and that affects how I interact with people and which of my identities I’m most conscious of. Conversely, if I’m in the UK, the fact I’m British becomes the assumed norm that nobody will feel the need to comment on… but the fact I think of myself as European is a charged, contentious, politicised identity that shapes my interactions there. 

#### Dealing with identity in Prosopography 

There are some key things to learn from the above about how we deal with identity in prosopography. The most important is that you need to be able to assign multiple identities in a particular category: there is no category of identity that is consistently simple enough that a dropdown menu will suffice. Some sort of tagging system tends to be ideal, such that you can add as many identity tags to a person as necessary. In a factoid database, dealing with identities is simpler than in a person-prosopon database – because all you need to put in is what the text says, and if it doesn’t say it, it isn’t there. You will still however need to think about how to categorise: for example, if someone mentions going to church in a letter, does that definitively flag them as Christian? This is one of the reasons why one can’t have a “neutral” prosopography dataset. Categorisation, which is necessary to make prosopography useful, is inherently subjective. 

In a person-prosopon database, more thought needs to go into whether an assignation of identity is valid or not. For most purposes, most textual evidence of identity can be treated as valid but there may be exceptions. You may decide for example that you only want identity evidence gathered from some perspectives, for example leaving out identities that are attested by people from further afield who may not have understood the cultural context of what they were looking at, or identities you think are attested as a proxy for political attacks rather than as something people actually thought at the time. If you are going to pass over evidence in this way, it’s important to note that the evidence exists and explain why it’s not been included. 

Should we ever, and can we validly, attach identities to people in our database that aren’t textually assigned/that we don’t have explicit evidence for? The answer for a factoid/indexing database is no – this isn’t what a factoid model is meant to do – but for a person-prosopon/secondary database the answer is yes, if you have reason to believe that they’re implicit in your sources and valid according to your model. A key example would be that if, say, you were reading a collection of letters by some seventeenth century Austrians, it would be very likely that none of them would ever explicitly state that they or their correspondents were Austrian. It just doesn’t make sense to do so. So in these cases, we should have a way. Often, finding a way of tagging an assumed identity, and flagging it as such separately from an attested identity as mentioned in the text, is useful here.

Often, finding a way of tagging an assumed identity, and flagging it as such separately from an attested identity as mentioned in the text, is useful here. There are some things that are very hard, if not impossible, to model effectively about identity in a prosopographical database. The situational aspects of it fall into this area – the inputs and context that lead someone to present or be seen as a particular part of their identity over another are usually too complex for us to meaningfully incorporate in these sorts of analyses, we don’t have enough data to do so. The best we can do is to represent attested possibilities, plus (in the case of person-prosopon databases) any that we think should be there but aren’t mentioned. 

#### Modelling Change Over Time

A second difficulty is modelling change over time, for example if someone converted from one faith to another – this one could find a way of modelling, but it would be comparatively structurally complex, as you’d need to be able to make the link between the person and identity contain additional information – for example, in the case mentioned, the ID code of an event before or after which a certain identity was treated as valid or invalid. Graph database software like neo4j allows for edge properties: when producing tabulated data, this may require making any links that need this sort of information a separate table in their own right. Also note that identity transitions in reality are not neat, singular events, which makes the above way of modelling it very rudimentary at best – but it’s something to consider if your topic suggests it might be useful.

## Conclusion

In this resource, you should have learned how to handle identity in prosopography, including ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality, and religion. You should also now understand the unique nuances of more complex forms of identities. Identities as a category are very different: they are fluid, multi-layered, subject to interpretation and fluctuations over time. These nuances all require an understanding of how we are using information about one's identity in our research and require attention to the goals of the prosopographic data collection. With these insights, you can approach historical research with a more nuanced perspective, recognizing the complex and dynamic nature of identity.
