The course builds upon Extracting Lexical Data: XPath for Dictionary Nerds and introduces the basics of XSL Transformations (XSLT), a standard language for transforming XML documents. After explaining the basic syntax and processing model of XSLT (stylesheet declarations, templates, pattern matching etc.), the course will guide students through a number of real-life dictionary-specific scenarios (renaming, adding or removing elements and attributes, rearranging and sorting elements, performing tests, hiding and showing portions of the dictionary content etc.) in order to help them improve their skills. At the end of this course, students will be able to write their own XSLT stylesheets to transform lexicographic data.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the basic syntax and processing model of XSLT
- assess different use-case scenarios for XPath and XSLT
- write their own XSLT stylesheets to transform lexicographic data
