Since May 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) has been in force in all European member states. This affects not only the private sector, but also the academic one. 

In the course of an academic career, you will most certainly collect and process personal data from third parties - be it in the context of your research or because you are organizing a conference, where you have to collect personal data of the attendees. This makes it especially important - from a legal and an ethical perspective - that the data processing is done in a GDPR-compliant manner. 

To help you with this, we would like to introduce you to the most important terms and concepts of the GDPR. We will also show you the ELDAH Consent Form Wizard, a tool that allows you to create GDPR-compliant consent forms for personal data collection in a research context, which you can adapt to your particular research purpose.

## Key terms in the GDPR

In the first part of the video-series, we will take a closer look at some **general information about the GDPR**. We will clarify what the GDPR applies to, **what "data processing" means** in the sense of the GDPR and what **data categories** it actually concerns (keywords: _personal data_ and _sensitive data_). We will also get to know **two ways of handling data** that help to increase data protection - _anonymization_ and _pseudonymization_ of data.

## Principles, rights and obligations laid out in the GDPR

In this part of the video-series we will look at **7 "principles"** which allow for - and are **obligatory** for - the processing of personal data according to the GDPR and will learn what each of these principles mean. Furthermore, we will look at **key roles** in the data processing context addressed in the GDPR and their **rights and obligations**. _<Download url="images/data-protection-in-research-practice-ii-principles-rights-and-responsibilities.pptx" title="(Click here to download the slides used in the video) " />_

## The GDPR in Science and Research

Now that the first two videos have clarified the most important terms and concepts, we will focus in this part on the **impact of the GDPR on science and research,** and we will also learn about the **exemptions** created in the GDPR in the context of **public archiving and research**. _<Download url="images/data-protection-in-research-practice-iii-the-gdpr-in-science-and-research-.pptx" title="(Click here to download the slides used in the video)" />_

## How to easily create GDPR-compliant consent forms - The ELDAH Consent Form Wizard

After discussing the most important terms and concepts of the GDPR and learning about the exemptions for science and research, the time has come to approach this topic more practice-oriented.

Therefore, in this video, we will take a closer look at the ELDAH Consent Form Wizard, developed by the DARIAH-EU's working group for "Ethics and legality in the digital arts and humanities" (ELDAH). This step-by-step guide will show you how you can use this tool to easily create consent forms tailored to specific research purposes.
