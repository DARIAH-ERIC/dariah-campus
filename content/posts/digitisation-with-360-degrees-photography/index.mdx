This resource is an introduction to 360 degrees panorama photography. It explores different types of panoramic representations and examples of 360 degree panoramas in the cultural heritage domain. Practical advice and step by step guidance on how to capture data and process them is also included in order to produce and publish 360 degrees panorama images.

Spherical panorama images are popular for documenting Cultural Heritage, because they allow to visualise an accurate and rich representation of cultural environment from a vantage point, and give viewers the possibility to explore the surroundings of a certain environment with ease.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this course, learners will:

- Define 360 degrees panoramas and distinguish different methods for capturing 360 degrees images.
- Practise 360 degrees acquisition, processing, production and publishing of a panoramic representation of a setting or space.
