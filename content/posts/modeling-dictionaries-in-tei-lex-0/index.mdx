The course will focus on modeling dictionaries using TEI Lex-0, a subset of the community standard TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). The course will focus on best-practices and recommendations in view of accuracy, consistency and interoperability of lexicographic data. At the end of this course, the students will become familiar with the underlying principles and the explicit guidelines of TEI Lex-0 by learning how to encode a number of dictionary entries through step-by-step tutorials with the ultimate goal of being able to adopt TEI Lex-0 in their own work.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the importance of using community-established best practices for encoding dictionaries
- recognize the differences in scope between TEI and TEI Lex-0
- efficiently use both TEI and TEI Lex-0 Guidelines
- encode moderately complex dictionary entries using TEI Lex-0
- identify channels of communication with TEI and TEI Lex-0 experts
