Riccardo Pozzo is chair of the History of Philosophy at University of Rome Tor Vergata and chair of the DARIAH Scientific Board. The focus of his keynote is on the notion of cultural innovation, which requires adapting the process of co-creation. Processes and outcomes of cultural innovation are contrasted against other forms of innovation, while showing their operationalisation in some empirical case studies.

The keynote was recorded at the DESIR Final Event, in November 2019, in Zagreb, Croatia. The event was organised in the framework of the Horizon 2020 funded project DESIR (DARIAH ERIC Sustainability Refined).
