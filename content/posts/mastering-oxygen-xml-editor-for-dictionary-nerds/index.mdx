This course will help users learn how to use oXygen XML, a versatile, professional-grade XML editor to edit, validate, query and transform lexicographic data. The course will focus on a range of practical and time-saving functionalities and features, such as the schema-based tool tips, document and code templates, customizable shortcuts as well as different editing modes (text, grid and CSS-styled Author) which can be used to adapt the display of dictionaries to one’s particular editing needs. At the end of this course, the students will have become accustomed to the oXygen editing environment and ready to work productively and efficiently in it.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- customize their working environment in oXygen to improve lexicographic workflows
- understand, set up and exploit oXygen projects
- create individual shortcuts and use code templates to speed up encoding practice
- use create styles for Author Mode in oXygen

TODO: important! point to the basic functionalities of oXygen from previous courses -- including: validation and transformation scenarios. Make sure they are included there (without reference to "projects" and from there point out that the concept of projects will be introduced here... )
