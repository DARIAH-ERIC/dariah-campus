This course will help users learn how to use oXygen XML, a versatile, professional-grade XML editor to edit, validate, query and transform lexicographic data. The course will focus on a range of practical and time-saving functionalities and features, such as the schema-based tool tips, document and code templates, customizable shortcuts as well as different editing modes (text, grid and CSS-styled Author) which can be used to adapt the display of dictionaries to oneâ€™s particular editing needs. At the end of this course, the students will have become accustomed to the oXygen editing environment and ready to work productively and efficiently in it.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
