This course will introduce the theories, practices, and methods of digitizing legacy dictionaries for research, preservation and online distribution by focusing on the process of converting paper-based dictionaries to electronic format through image capture, text capture, data modeling and data enrichment. In addition to explaining how various OCR and HCR tools can be used to extract text from images, the course will focus on analyzing, identifying and describing lexicographic data using markup languages such as XML in order to produce semantically structured datasets that can be easily queried, shared and transformed to different outputs. The course will be of interest not only to those who are converting legacy dictionaries, but also those who want to understand the principles and modes of representing structured lexicographic data, which will be a prerequisite for more advanced coursework on TEI Lex-0, OntoLex-Lemon, XPath and XSLT.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the challenges involved in converting paper-based dictionaries to digital format
- identify tools that can help with the conversion process
- appreciate the complexity of lexicographic data as structured data
- model simple dictionary entries and express them in XML
