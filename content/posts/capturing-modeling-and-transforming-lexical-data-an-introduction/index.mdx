This course will introduce the theories, practices, and methods of digitizing legacy dictionaries for research, preservation and online distribution by focusing on the process of converting paper-based dictionaries to electronic format through image capture, text capture, data modeling and data enrichment. In addition to explaining how various OCR and HCR tools can be used to extract text from images, the course will focus on analyzing, identifying and describing lexicographic data using markup languages such as XML in order to produce semantically structured datasets that can be easily queried, shared and transformed to different outputs. The course will be of interest not only to those who are converting legacy dictionaries, but also those who want to understand the principles and modes of representing structured lexicographic data, which will be a prerequisite for more advanced coursework on TEI Lex-0, OntoLex-Lemon, XPath and XSLT.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the challenges involved in converting paper-based dictionaries to digital format
- identify tools that can help with the conversion process
- appreciate the complexity of lexicographic data as structured data
- model simple dictionary entries and express them in XML

## Introduction

## Digitization workflow

- Planing (Conceptual vs. organizational phase)
- Image and text capture
- data modeling
- data enrichment
- publication
- maintenance

### Capturing lexicographic data

#### Image capture

- digital cameras vs. scanners
- document scanners vs. book scanners
- image formats and optimization

#### Text capture

- OCR
- HRT
- Manual input

  - single vs. double (or multiple) keying
- Post-correction

  - OCR, HRT, comparison tools
- Rich (styled) vs. plain text

### Modeling lexicographic data

What is a model? Why do we model? Model-of vs. model-for.

#### Markup languages

- Textual hierarchies, OHCO (ordered hierarchy of content objects) and the notion of structured data
- Types of markup and metadata

#### Modeling with XML

- Intro to XML as markup language
- XML and its advantages

  - device independence
  - machine and human readability
  - separation of data and visual presentation
- searchability. XPATH.
- transformability. XSLT.

#### XML: Building blocks and basic rules

##### Elements and rules for element names

##### Attributes

##### Processing instructions and character entities

##### Nesting elements

##### Well-formed vs. valid XML

##### Element relationships (children, parents, siblings, ancestors etc. )

#### Editing XML with oXygen

## Where next?

This section will point in the direction of other courses in the ELEXIS Curriculum, especially TEI, Ontolex Lemon, Mastering oXygen, XPATH and XSLT for Nerds.
