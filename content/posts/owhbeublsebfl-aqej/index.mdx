This learning block is focused on project management – the knowledge and tools needed to achieve specific goals within specific constraints. 

Project management is applied across many different fields and while there are some variations in the skills needed the basics of project management methods are the same – whether you are building a bridge or creating a language corpora. Best practices in this area have been collected for more than half a century and thus there is an abundance of learning materials available to help you up your project management skills. Therefore in this block, we provide a curated selection of the most useful and user-friendly online resources. In addition, we present a set of exercises in project management specifically designed for language and linguistics specialists. Finally, we provide a student project task to complete the learning experience.

The pedagogical approach behind this block is that students take an active approach in learning. We provide definitions of important concepts accompanied by examples and practical activities that will guide students towards their deeper understanding. 

The block’s units are conceived in a modular way that allows lecturers and learners to take (or adapt) them either in sequence or as self-standing contents, depending on their needs.

After completing this course learners will be able to:

- explain the general concepts of project management;
