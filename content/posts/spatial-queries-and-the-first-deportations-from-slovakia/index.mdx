abstract: In the late 1930s, just before war broke in Europe, a series of chaotic deporations took place expelling thousands of Jews from what is now Slovakia.  As part of his research, Michel Frankl investigates the backgrounds of the deported people, and the trajectory of the journey they were taken on.  This practical blog describes the tools and processes of analysis, and shows how a spatially enabled database can be made useful for answering similar questions in the humanities, and Holocaust Studies in particular.

As part of his research (see EC-funded project Unlikely Refuge ([https://www.unlikely-refuge.eu](https://www.unlikely-refuge.eu/)), Michal Frankl examined the deportations of Jews from Slovakia in November 1938, many of whom were subsequently trapped along the demarcation line between the Czecho-Slovak and Hungarian post. The little known and extremely chaotic deportations were ordered by the Slovak President Jozef Tiso who blamed Jewish influence for the [First Vienna Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vienna_Award), an international arbitration which forced (Czecho-)Slovakia to cede southern Slovakia to Hungary.[](https://blog.ehri-project.eu/2019/12/12/spatial-queries-first-deportations-slovakia/#en-3886-1)

Michal's research focussed on some key questions: What kind of knowledge did the local officials apply to recognize “alien” Jews? What was the citizenship of those who were deported?  For example, were they citizens of Hungary, in the new borders, or of other states?  How many were stateless? And how many Czechoslovak citizens were put on trucks and sent towards the Hungarian border?

To answer these questions, Michal and his team digitised lists kept in the [Slovak National Archives](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/institutions/sk-003250) and compiled a database of the deportees containing information about their birth places, domicile and/or citizenship and place from which they were deported.  This resource outlines the steps the team took, and demonstrates how geospatial data such as this can be used to create visualisations that can reveal patterns and connections.

## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

- Recognise the benefit of using gazeteers such as Geonames (or any similar resource) and spatial queries to ask new research questions
- Learn how standardisation makes the process of building of visualisations (e.g. in the form of maps) much smoother
- Use spatial visualisations to reveal connections and patterns that otherwise would remain invisible
