## Introduction

## What is VOICE 3.0 Online?

**VOICE** (**V**ienna-**O**xford **I**nternational **C**orpus of **E**nglish) is a computerized open-access corpus capturing more than one million words of naturally-occurring, spoken English as a lingua franca (ELF) interactions. It is based on 151 audio-recordings involving 753 identified individuals from 49 different first language backgrounds using English as a common means of communication.

The VOICE corpus was created between 2005 and 2013 at the University of Vienna with funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) to provide a source for linguistic research that does not concentrate on English as spoken and written by speakers of English as first language, but instead focuses on the use of ELF, the most-wide spread contemporary use of English throughout the world. Since its first release in 2009, VOICE texts are stored in TEI-based XML format and rendered accessible online through an online user interface. Between spring 2020 and autumn 2021, a new TEI-XML version of VOICE (VOICE 3.0 XML [available in ARCHE](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/oeaw_detail/171762)) was created and a new open-access user interface, [VOICE 3.0 Online](https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at), was developed with funding from CLARIAH-AT. This interface, released in autumn 2021 at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), offers search facilities, expanded filter and style options, an improved bookmarking tool and new download functions that will be explained in this chapter.

More detailed information on the compilation and history of the corpus can be found on the [VOICE homepage](https://voice.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/aboutvoice) or in the VOICE Corpus Header in [VOICE 3.0 Online](https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/#/tool) (click "Corpus Information" and select "VOICE Header").

In addition, you can check out the recordings of the ACDH-CH Tool Gallery 8.1 on “[Spoken corpora and open access: Usability and Technology of VOICE 3.0 Online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0wiGwlUlbem5euvpMLxpnkDljOZ6k_2)” from April 2022. These provide further information on the compilation of the VOICE corpus, the pros and cons of open access corpora and detailed information on the Open Access technologies, like the local NoSketch Engine set up to run queries, its technology stacks and software packages.
