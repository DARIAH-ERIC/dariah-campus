## Introduction

## What is VOICE 3.0 Online?

**VOICE** (**V**ienna-**O**xford **I**nternational **C**orpus of **E**nglish) is a computerized open-access corpus capturing more than one million words of naturally-occurring, spoken English as a lingua franca (ELF) interactions. It is based on 151 audio-recordings involving 753 identified individuals from 49 different first language backgrounds using English as a common means of communication.

The VOICE corpus was created between 2005 and 2013 at the University of Vienna with funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) to provide a source for linguistic research that does not concentrate on English as spoken and written by speakers of English as first language, but instead focuses on the use of ELF, the most-wide spread contemporary use of English throughout the world. Since its first release in 2009, VOICE texts are stored in TEI-based XML format and rendered accessible online through an online user interface. Between spring 2020 and autumn 2021, a new TEI-XML version of VOICE (VOICE 3.0 XML [available in ARCHE](https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browser/oeaw_detail/171762)) was created and a new open-access user interface, [VOICE 3.0 Online](https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at), was developed with funding from CLARIAH-AT. This interface, released in autumn 2021 at the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), offers search facilities, expanded filter and style options, an improved bookmarking tool and new download functions that will be explained in this chapter.

More detailed information on the compilation and history of the corpus can be found on the [VOICE homepage](https://voice.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/aboutvoice) or in the VOICE Corpus Header in [VOICE 3.0 Online](https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/#/tool) (click "Corpus Information" and select "VOICE Header").

In addition, you can check out the recordings of the ACDH-CH Tool Gallery 8.1 on “[Spoken corpora and open access: Usability and Technology of VOICE 3.0 Online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN0wiGwlUlbem5euvpMLxpnkDljOZ6k_2)” from April 2022. These provide further information on the compilation of the VOICE corpus, the pros and cons of open access corpora and detailed information on the Open Access technologies, like the local NoSketch Engine set up to run queries, its technology stacks and software packages.

## Accessing VOICE 3.0

To access VOICE 3.0 Online, go to [https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at](https://voice3.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/). If this is your first visit with a particular PC or particular internet browser, you will first be asked to accept – or decline – the use of tracking and cookies. In VOICE 3.0, cookies are used in an anonymous fashion only, without collecting data that can be tracked back to an individual. You can also opt out and use VOICE without cookies. Both settings can also be changed later on in the frontend as well.

Once you have selected your preferences for cookies, the content in the blue area of the **landing page** **changes**. It now gives you the option to explore VOICE, either by **typing in a search query** or by simply clicking "**Browse**" - this takes you to the actual VOICE 3.0 Online interface.

</Figure>
The standard design of the VOICE 3.0 web interface is made up of three main areas:

- The area on the **left-hand side** contains the **corpus tree**. The first order of organization is domain. By activating the **SPET** (**SP**eech **E**vent **T**ype) shifter above the corpus tree, the second layer of organization according to speech event types is made available. By clicking on the small arrow next to a domain, a list with the speech events in this domain appears and displays the unique ID of each speech event. An audio symbol next to an ID indicates that a sound file is available for this event. When you click on a particular speech event, it will be opened on the right-hand side.
- The **middle area** contains the **search field** and will display the **search results** once a query has been run.
- On the **right-hand side**, users are initially greeted by a **welcome text**. As soon as you have started using the corpus, the **entire transcripts** or corpus information on the speech events you have selected, as well as **metadata** from TEI headers will be displayed here. Once a particular speech event has been opened, you **can switch between different styles** (VOICE, PLAIN, POS and XML). If a sound file is available, you can use the **audio player at the bottom**. Several speech events can be opened next to each other and can be navigated via separate tabs.

The **buttons above the right-hand area** are especially useful: the big button “**Corpus information**” gives you access to more extensive PDF manuals, like the search manual and the VOICE transcription conventions. The **two symbols** next to "Corpus information" allow you to **adjust the display settings**: with the left icon, you can **merge colons**, the right icon allows to adjust the display to a **narrow screen** (e.g. for a mobile phone). Clicking on the same icon again brings you back to the default view.
The new VOICE 3.0 Online interface provides many integrated tool tips, pop-ups and links to more extensive PDFs with corpus documentation. The goal has been to design an interface that is easy and intuitive to navigate and immediately provides short explanations to the user, while also offering links to more extensive guidelines where useful or necessary.

The following clip offers an introductory tour of the VOICE 3.0 Online interface and explains its main areas and buttons.

## Searches in VOICE 3.0

Searches can be easily carried out with the help of the **search field** at the top left corner of the middle area. Once a search has been run, all search results will be displayed in this area. You can then adjust the display of your results by switching between the different **styles** offered (i.e. **VOICE, PLAIN, POS,** and **XML**). For VOICE, PLAIN and POS, you can additionally choose to display results in **KWIC** (KeyWord In Context) view. When you choose VOICE or POS style, further modifications are possible by using the options offered at the bottom. These allow you to selectively display - or hide - different mark-up categories according to your research needs or to change the representation of POS (part-of-speech) tags.

### Simple Searches

#### Token search (word form)

In order to search for a word or word form (i.e. token queries), enter the word using lower-case characters, e.g. _speak_. Please note that all queries are case-sensitive and tokens are searched for with lower case characters, e.g. _i speak french,_ as this is how they are represented in VOICE transcripts. You can, of course, search for phrases (i.e. token token) as well.

If you want to search for contracted forms, like _wanna, gonna, don’t,_ etc., you need to insert a space before the contracted part in your query in VOICE 3.0 Online, i.e.: _wan na, gon na, do n’t, it ‘s_.

#### Lemma search

A lemma is the basic form of a word, which represents all declensions and inflected forms of a word, e.g. _walk_ is the lemma of _walk, walks, walking_. To search for all tokens of a lemma, use the form “l:lemma”, e.g. _l:walk_.
