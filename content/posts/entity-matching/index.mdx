abstract: EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure) supports the use of
  digital tools that can assist in the research of Holocaust and refugee related
  topics. In a continued effort to make these tools as accessible as possible so
  that researchers who have no experience with digital tools will consider
  trying new ways of using their data, this GitHub-based lesson showcases the
  use of entity match tools when dealing with geographic data.

EHRI (European Holocaust Research Infrastructure) supports the use of digital tools that can assist in the research of Holocaust and refugee related topics. It works to make these tools as accessible as possible so that researchers who have no experience with digital tools will consider trying new ways of using their data.

A number of datasets presented at EHRI related events contain place names that researchers wish to present on maps. In order to accurately display locations, latitude and longitude coordinates are essential. EHRI has created an entity matching tool to help researchers find coordinates for present day locations.

Using a dataset of birthplaces of refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, this GitHub-based demonstration makes use of an entity matching tool to demonstrate how researchers may wish to manage their spatial data.

## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

\- understand entity matching techniques in the use of spatial data

\- create data visualisations using mapping tools such as Google Maps
