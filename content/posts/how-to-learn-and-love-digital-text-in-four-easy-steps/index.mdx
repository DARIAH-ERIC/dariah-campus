Is ChatGPT unsettling you? Are you annoyed to always land on the same webportal when googling for a specific book? Do you hate it when just the one page you need to consult is nowhere to be found on the internet? This presentation is for you!

In general, textual scholars are only half convinced by the performances of digital textual resources. This Friday Frontiers webinar aims to remedy this misconception. It defines precise quality mechanisms for digital text in order to provide a better grasp on the potential it bears, arguing that the cooperation between human and machine is key to contribute to enfolding it.

You will hear how to represent, connect, open, and share digital text in such a way that it can preserve heritage, advance knowledge and save planetary resources. What is there not to love about that?

Anne Baillot is a Professor for German Studies at the University of Le Mans, France. Her research areas include German Literature, Digital Editing, Textual Studies and History of Ideas. She is a passionate advocate of Open Science and currently working towards a stronger inclusion of environmental issues in research processes, especially digital ones.
