This course describes the OntoLex-Lemon model, a recent standard for the representation of lexical information on the Web as linked data. In addition to providing a basic introduction to linked data and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the course will cover the core model of OntoLex and how to represent basic lexical information. Additional modules of the OntoLex module for the description of syntax, term decomposition, variation & translation, metadata, lexicography, morphology and corpus information will also be described. At the end of the course, students should be able to express lexicons as linked data using the model.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- Understand how lexical data can be represented as linked data
- Describe the benefits of linked data for lexicography
- Use the OntoLex-Lemon module to model lexical information
- Design a schema based on OntoLex-Lemon to represent a specific lexical resource
