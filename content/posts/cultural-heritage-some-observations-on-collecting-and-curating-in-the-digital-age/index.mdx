Archives and museums have a long history of collecting, curating and conserving objects that reflect a given culture’s history and heritage, but increasingly, our intellectual and creative outputs are born-digital. How do we ensure that these outputs — these digital objects — are properly stewarded for future generations to access, interrogate, and enjoy? Spanning the topics of digital preservation, public humanities, archival enrichment, and the democratisation of cultural heritage, this talk by the Director of the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) explores why we should care, as a society, about digital preservation and what opportunities the digital offers for the humanities and social sciences.
