abstract: "This training event from the TRIPLE Project is jointly organised with
  the SSHOC Project and is dedicated to the creation, use and management of
  controlled vocabularies in the SSH. In this training session, the presenters
  highlight the need for multilingual SSH vocabularies and provide answers to
  the following questions: What are SSH Vocabularies and why are they so
  important; How to create a multilingual SSH Vocabulary (The TRIPLE case); How
  to build an interoperable infrastructure for vocabularies (The SSHOC case)."

This webinar is part of the [TRIPLE Open Science Training Series](https://project.gotriple.eu/training/).

This training session is a synergy of TRIPLE and SSHOC projects and focuses on controlled vocabularies for Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). It is led by Daan Broeder with contributions from other SSHOC partners ([CLARIN ERIC](https://www.clarin.eu/)/[SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/)), Haris Georgiadis ([EKT](https://www.ekt.gr/en/index)/[TRIPLE](https://project.gotriple.eu/)) and Nikos Vasilogamvrakis ([EKT](https://www.ekt.gr/en/index)).

Vocabularies are presented as organised arrangements of words and phrases used to annotate, index and retrieve content through browsing or searching. Nikos Vasilogamvrakis  explains that the standardised terms which make controlled vocabularies do not intend to include natural language terms. In fact, these terms are concepts linked to each other by a series of relationships which form a network of concepts. 

The work performed within the TRIPLE project to create a multilingual SSH vocabulary to be used for annotating (tagging) the publications hosted in the GoTriple platform is presented by Iraklis Katsaloulis, along with ways to increase the multilingualism of the vocabulary.

Finally, Daan Broeder introduces Vocabularies in the SSHOC project and the importance of multilinguality based on two case studies. He also presents the priorities and recommendations towards an SSH Vocabularies Commons.
