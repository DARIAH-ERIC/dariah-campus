This resource provides guidance on how to use digital storytelling, deploying 3D data, annotations and combining media to enable users to access and explore information about digital heritage assets over the web.

**Learning Outcomes**

Understand digital storytelling and explain why publishing and sharing 3D models over the web is important to allow for access, dissemination and interpretation of cultural heritage.

Illustrate some of the available options for publishing 3D models over the web, while being compliant with FAIR principles.

Test various platforms for publishing and creating annotations for 3D models and produce an example of digital storytelling with 3D data and other media.
