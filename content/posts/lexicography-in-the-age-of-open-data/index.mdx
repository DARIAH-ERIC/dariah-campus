Technology should not necessarily be seen as the ultimate challenge facing lexicography today: social, cultural and legal obstacles often stand in the way of collaboration and knowledge sharing. This course explores the principles of open access, open data, FAIR principles and open science as they apply to lexicography including the specific challenges posed by intellectual property rights and copyright issues in the context of lexicographic work.
