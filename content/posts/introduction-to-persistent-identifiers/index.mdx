As part of the DARIAH Friday Frontiers in-house webinar series, Dr. Tibor Kálman (GWDG) gives an introduction to Persistent Identifiers. Why do we need them, how do we apply them, and how do (digital) arts and humanities scholars benefit from them in particular? 

This webinar focuses on 'Persistent Identifiers' (PIDs) and basic concepts of referencing objects. It discusses why so many PID platforms exist, presents aspects of sustainability, demonstrates some added-value services, and talks about practical experiences and open issues. 

The DARIAH Friday Frontiers in-house webinars run in Spring and Autumn series for members of the DARIAH community. Each series features researchers and projects related to the digital arts and humanities and assumes no prior knowledge, making them accessible to all.

## Learning Outcomes

After viewing this webinar, learners will:

- Understand what is meant by Persistent Identifier (PID)
- Recognise how they can be used to improve accessibility and openness of (digital) humanities and arts data and research outputs
