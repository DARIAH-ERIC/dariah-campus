This course will explore the notion of lexicographic evidence and the limitation of subjective views on language by tracing the changes in lexicographic practice from the extensive use of manually selected citations to the employment of large language corpora. The course will introduce the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design, as well as the role played by various NLP tools such as taggers and parsers. At the end of this course, the students will have a basic understanding of how corpora can be used in dictionary writing, both for lemma selection, sense disambiguation, composing good definitions, choosing good examples and for automatic term and collocation extraction.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design
- determine the suitability of a corpus for a particular project
- understand the role of the corpus in lexicographic practice
-

### Dependencies

This course provides the theoretical background to using corpora in lexicographic practice. If you are interested in getting hands-on experience, we suggest continuing with the course LEX2: Mastering ELEXIS Corpus Tools for Lexicographic Purposes.



## Lexicographic evidence: from slips to corpora

_The craft of lexicography demands not only the ability to collect data, but also the ability to make sense of it.     SUE ATKINS_

Evidence-based lexicographic projects use authentic linguistic material as their primary source. Authentic refers to what McEnery and Wilson (2001) call “real life language use”.  This authentic linguistic material comes in various forms - data gained through introspection, citation files and corpora. In this chapter, we will first explore and evaluate these different forms of lexicographic evidence and we will describe the changes in lexicographic practice from the extensive use of manually selected citations to the employment of large language corpora.

### Introspection

By introspection we mean that the lexicographer gives an account of a word and its meaning by consulting his or her own mental lexicon (i.e. all the knowledge about words and language stored in his/her brain), and retrieving relevant facts about that word. Native speakers can do this. They are able to evaluate observed linguistic data independently and determine whether or not they are acceptable, correct, normal, frequent, etc. 

Introspection can also be the result of the data collection from informants by consulting the mental lexicon. Informants may be asked to determine the degree of acceptability of words and expressions presented to them or they may be asked to choose between different expressions. This method is used extensively in field linguistics for cataloguing the vocabulary of languages which exist only in oral form. A revival of the method can be seen in various crowdsourcing efforts in lexicography. 

However, a certain amount of caution is in order when using data gained through introspection. Introspection can lead to subjective judgements influenced by the environment, education, geographical region and personal belief of the person. For instance, English has some [750,000,000 speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) and  [170,000 words](https://www.lexico.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language) (or 800,000 according to some sources). One expert or even a large group of experts cannot possess the knowledge of how these 750,000,000 users use all the 170,000 words. In addition, it is idiosyncratic uses of words which tend to catch the eye and tend to be noted and remembered by people creating additional biases in their judgement. For these reasons introspection alone cannot form the basis of a reliable dictionary.

See also Hanks (2013:4): "The tradition of speculative approaches to the study of language through the invention of data is particularly regrettable because the focus on boundary cases supported by invented examples left linguistics drowning in a welter of imagined possibilities, while the central and typical norms of languages as systems were neglected - or were assumed to be so obvious that they were not worth studying."

### Citation files

Citation files, also known as quotation slips, have a long history. For about two centuries they were the main form of empirical language data available to lexicographers. A citation is a short extract from a text which provides evidence for a word, phrase, usage or meaning in authentic use (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 48) together with source information and other kinds of pertinent information (Svensen 2009:41).

Citations have conventionally been collected through reading programs, an “organized data-gathering exercise” (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 49) set up by a publisher where readers examine texts and excerpt from these texts lexical items which are considered for inclusion in the dictionary. Until the late 20th century, the excerpts would be written or typed on index cards (known as “slips”) following the specifications from the publisher. 

Samuel Johnson was the first English lexicographer to use citations “systematically” (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 48) as the basis for his dictionary of the English language published in 1755 (Hartmann 1983: 19). Johnson intended that all entries in his dictionary be supported by citations taken from “superior” literature (Jackson 2002: 44, 166).

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) also draws upon millions of citations (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 49; Green 1996: 316-323; Jackson 2002: 48, 166). In contrast to Johnson, [James Murray](https://public.oed.com/history/chief-editors/#james-murray), the principal editor of the OED, intended that the citations should not come solely from eminent authors and prestigious literary works, but be drawn from all types of publications, even “low and trivial sources” (Read 1986: 28-29). 

Also in the Germanic tradition citations have been used extensively in the compilation of dictionaries. Already in 1838, Wilhelm Grimm gave specific guidelines for the citations used for the Deutsches Wörterbuch (DWB):

> Ich wünsche dass die Excerpte zu dem Wörterb. auf einzelne kleine Duodezblättchen geschrieben werden, die man alle in Kasten werfen muss, u. zu deren endlicher alphabet \[...]. Das Wort muss jedesmal unterstrichen werden. Dies ist eine mühselige mechanische, aber an sich gar nicht schwierige Arbeit (Kirkness 1980, 68 cited in Wortel 1997).
>
> (I wish that the excerpts for the dictionary are written on individual small Duodez leaves, all of which have to be put into boxes, according to the alphabet \[...]. The word has to be underlined every time. This is tedious mechanical work, but not difficult in itself)

This was further specified as follows: 

> alle auszüge müssen auf sedezblätter \[sedecimo], die man bequem ordnen kann, auf jedes blatt nur ein wort mit genauem citat, so dass die möglichst beste ausgabe gebraucht und in der einleitung vornen angegeben wird. der ausziehende darf sich nicht verdriessen lassen merkwürdige wörter zehnmal und mehr aufzuzeichnen und in dem zusammenhang der ganzen phrase, der redactor muss diese sicher und ohne nachzuschlagen verstehn können, wenn er von den zehn beispielen etwa nur zwei behält, die andern wegwirft (Kirkness 1980, 71 cited in Wortel 1997).
>
> (all excerpts must be on sedecimo sheets, which are easy to organize, only one word with an exact quotation on each sheet so that the best possible edition is used and given in the introduction. the person who excerpts should not get lost in writing down strange words ten times or more but should write down enough context such that the editor can understand the excerpts correctly and without further checking when he keeps about two of the ten examples and throws the others away.)
>
> Following Grimm, De Vries, founder of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal, specified that each word to be included in the dictionary had to be 'marked' on a separate sheet of 'Dutch writing paper', quarto format, with cut edges. Where possible, these paper slips should also contain quotations and comments regarding etymology or grammar. This way everything that was needed for writing the dictionary entry was collected on those sheets saving a great deal of time because the entry could be edited 'almost completely without checking and comparing books' (De Vries, Verl. 1854, 14).

Several collaborators had been appointed, who, under the direction of the editors, were engaged in making 'excerpts, partly by means of copies, by researching, comparing, arranging, etc.' De Vries kept the extracts 'in specifically designed boxes' (De Vries, Ver. 1854, 10).

As one can imagine, excerption is laborious and time-consuming work. In addition, owing to the computerisation of lexicography, citation files no longer form the primary source of evidence and have gradually been replaced by large corpora. Excerption is sometimes still used though as a way for users to contribute new words through special forms on the dictionary publishers’ website.
