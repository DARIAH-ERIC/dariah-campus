This course will explore the notion of lexicographic evidence and the limitation of subjective views on language by tracing the changes in lexicographic practice from the extensive use of manually selected citations to the employment of large language corpora. The course will introduce the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design, as well as the role played by various NLP tools such as taggers and parsers. At the end of this course, the students will have a basic understanding of how corpora can be used in dictionary writing, both for lemma selection, sense disambiguation, composing good definitions, choosing good examples and for automatic term and collocation extraction.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design
- determine the suitability of a corpus for a particular project
- understand the role of the corpus in lexicographic practice
-

### Dependencies

This course provides the theoretical background to using corpora in lexicographic practice. If you are interested in getting hands-on experience, we suggest continuing with the course LEX2: Mastering ELEXIS Corpus Tools for Lexicographic Purposes.



## Lexicographic evidence: from slips to corpora

_The craft of lexicography demands not only the ability to collect data, but also the ability to make sense of it.     SUE ATKINS_

Evidence-based lexicographic projects use authentic linguistic material as their primary source. Authentic refers to what McEnery and Wilson (2001) call “real life language use”.

Authentic linguistic material comes in various forms - data gained through introspection, citation files and corpora. In this chapter, we will first explore and evaluate these different forms of lexicographic evidence and we will describe the changes in lexicographic practice from the extensive use of manually selected citations to the employment of large language corpora.

### Introspection

By introspection we mean that the lexicographer gives an account of a word and its meaning by consulting his or her own mental lexicon (i.e. all the knowledge about words and language stored in his/her brain), and retrieving relevant facts about that word. Native speakers can do this. They are able to evaluate observed linguistic data independently and determine whether or not they are acceptable, correct, normal, frequent, etc. 

Introspection can also be the result of the data collection from informants by consulting the mental lexicon. Informants may be asked to determine the degree of acceptability of words and expressions presented to them or they may be asked to choose between different expressions. This method is used extensively in field linguistics for cataloguing the vocabulary of languages which exist only in oral form. A revival of the method can be seen in various crowdsourcing efforts in lexicography. Link to crowdsourcing

However, a certain amount of caution is in order when using data gained through introspection. Introspection can lead to subjective judgements influenced by the environment, education, geographical region and personal belief of the person. For instance, English has some [750,000,000 speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) and  [170,000 words](https://www.lexico.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language) (or 800,000 according to some sources). One expert or even a large group of experts cannot possess the knowledge of how these 750,000,000 users use all the 170,000 words. In addition, it is idiosyncratic uses of words which tend to catch the eye and tend to be noted and remembered by people creating additional biases in their judgement. For these reasons introspection alone cannot form the basis of a reliable dictionary. 

### Citation files

Citation files, also known as quotation slips, have a long history. For about two centuries they were the main form of empirical language data available to lexicographers. A citation is a short extract from a text which provides evidence for a word, phrase, usage or meaning in authentic use (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 48) together with source information and other kinds of pertinent information (Svensen 2009:41).



Citations have conventionally been collected through reading programs, an “organized data-gathering exercise” (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 49) set up by a publisher where readers examine texts and excerpt from these texts lexical items which are considered for inclusion in the dictionary. Until the late 20th century, the excerpts would be written or typed on index cards (known as “slips”) following the specifications from the publisher. 



Samuel Johnson was the first English lexicographer to use citations “systematically” (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 48) as the basis for his dictionary of the English language published in 1755 (Hartmann 1983: 19). Johnson intended that all entries in his dictionary be supported by citations taken from “superior” literature (Jackson 2002: 44, 166).

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) also draws upon millions of citations (Atkins and Rundell 2008: 49; Green 1996: 316-323; Jackson 2002: 48, 166). In contrast to Johnson, [James Murray](https://public.oed.com/history/chief-editors/#james-murray), the principal editor of the OED, intended that the citations should not come solely from eminent authors and prestigious literary works, but be drawn from all types of publications, even “low and trivial sources” (Read 1986: 28-29).
