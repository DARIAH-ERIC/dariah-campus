This course will explore the notion of lexicographic evidence and the limitation of subjective views on language by tracing the changes in lexicographic practice from the extensive use of manually selected citations to the employment of large language corpora. The course will introduce the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design, as well as the role played by various NLP tools such as taggers and parsers. At the end of this course, the students will have a basic understanding of how corpora can be used in dictionary writing, both for lemma selection, sense disambiguation, composing good definitions, choosing good examples and for automatic term and collocation extraction.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- understand the fundamentals of corpus linguistics and corpus design
- determine the suitability of a corpus for a particular project
- understand the role of the corpus in lexicographic practice
