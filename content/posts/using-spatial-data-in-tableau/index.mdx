abstract: Tableau is a powerful digital tool for analysing data. In this short
  guide we will focus on one particular aspect of data analysis using mapping
  that has particular application for Holocaust and refugee studies. Sometimes
  just simply mapping your data is not enough, and you want to use other
  features such as changing the size of a marker above a location in order to
  demonstrate the number of people from that town or city. Tableau can help with
  this and can be used for free for 14 days, or is available free of charge to
  individuals teaching or researching at an academic institution.
