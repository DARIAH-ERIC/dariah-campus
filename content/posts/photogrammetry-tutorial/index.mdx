Photogrammetry is a technique that transforms photographs into high-quality 3D data, and itâ€™s used in various fields such as archaeology, civil engineering, film production, and game development. The tutorial guides users through the process of preparing an object for a photogrammetry scan, capturing photos, and using Kiri Engine to create a 3D model. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of the quality and quantity of photos in creating a high-quality 3D model. It also highlights the significant implications of photogrammetry in the humanities field, particularly in the preservation of historical and cultural artifacts.

## Learning Outcomes

After using this resource, learners will be able to:

- understand how photogrammetry is used to interpret and measure physical properties of objects or scenes from photographs
- use Kiri Engine to upload photos, perform 3D reconstruction, review and edit the 3D model, and export the model in various formats
- practically apply photogrammetry in a research context
- understand the implications of photogrammetry in the field of (digital) Humanities
