Photogrammetry is a technique that transforms photographs into high-quality 3D data, and it’s used in various fields such as archaeology, civil engineering, film production, and game development. The tutorial guides users through the process of preparing an object for a photogrammetry scan, capturing photos, and using Kiri Engine to create a 3D model. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of the quality and quantity of photos in creating a high-quality 3D model. It also highlights the significant implications of photogrammetry in the humanities field, particularly in the preservation of historical and cultural artifacts.

##Learning Outcomes

After using this resource, learners will be able to:

- understand how photogrammetry is used to interpret and measure physical properties of objects or scenes from photographs
- use Kiri Engine to upload photos, perform 3D reconstruction, review and edit the 3D model, and export the model in various formats
- practically apply photogrammetry in a research context
- understand the implications of photogrammetry in the field of (digital) Humanities
