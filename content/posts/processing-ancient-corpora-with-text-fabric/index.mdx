abstract: "Text-Fabric is an opiniated tool, written as a Python library to work
  with (ancient) text corpora and collections of annotations. The emphasis is on
  preprocessing, data extraction, and querying. It facilitates browsing,
  searching and displaying the text material with their annotations. It is
  agnostic to the kind of texts and the kind of annotations involved. It helps
  users to turn research outputs into new annotation sets that can be used by
  others with no friction. There is a big family of tutorials available for
  specific corpora, such as the Hebrew Bible, Cuneiform Tablets, and the
  Dhammapada. "

When researchers work with (ancient) text corpora there is usually a significant effort to manipulate the data so that it can be used to address research questions. This is called preprocessing. Even when the texts are in a standard form, such as TEI, preprocessing is needed to extract the bits of data that are needed for research tasks, such as statistical analysis in R or topic modelling, or linguistic analysis. 

There is a way to make preprocessing less tedious: storing the data in a kind of warehouse, neatly stacked and ordered, with identifying codes on each single object. It turns out that this idea improves the logistics of textual processing a lot.

When texts and their annotations are treated as warehouses of data the following benefits can be reaped:

1. it becomes much easier to share research outputs against a corpus
2. there is no implicit tree model in the data, which alleviates the problem of conflicting hierarchies in XML
3. corpus analysis is no longer dependent on tool chains that process a specific format, such as the XML tool chain.

However, the underlying data model is a drastic leap away from an XML encoded text with TEI markup. TEI feature structures is what comes closest, and in fact Text-Fabric uses a radical notion of stand-off markup, to the extent that the text itself is the content of a stand-off feature.

It takes a mental investment to get used to the model and ethos of Text-Fabric, including the practice to recycle annotation data freely.

This course is here to train you in the logistics of processing text and annotations.
