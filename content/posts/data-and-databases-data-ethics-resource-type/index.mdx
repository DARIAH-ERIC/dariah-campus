## Introduction 

When producing and processing humanities data, very often deal with information about people –unlike in for example physics or chemistry, the primary subjects of our research may be thinking, feeling beings, and that means that we have significant ethical and moral considerations in how we go about our data projects. Data is a powerful thing –indeed, this is a large aspect of how and why modern data collection and structuring methods were developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as states sought to operate and control resources more efficiently through better documenting their populations. We have responsibilities as researchers to ensure that information we hold about people is used and presented in a way that does not harm the people we are researching.

Some ethical considerations are defined and laid down in law: others are a matter for our own judgements. Both are important in our research practices, and should be written into research plans when we develop database projects.

## Learning outcomes

- Know when and how to anonymise personal data
- Understand the relationship between copyrights and textual data
