The course will introduce corpus tools available in ELEXIS and describe various ways in which they can be exploited in lexicographic research and for compiling dictionaries. At the end of the course, students will be able to build corpora, as well as evaluate their quality and suitability for the respective lexicographic task. Students will also acquire the skills necessary to work with the tools effectively to retrieve valid linguistic information from the corpus. Practical examples will simulate the use of these tools in the lexicographic workflow.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- build a corpus in Sketch Engine
- use Sketch Engine for data analysis in the lexicographic workflow

## Introduction

Sketch Engine contains many screens, settings, controls and statistics. It is beyond the scope of this course to give detailed information about each one of them. The user will, however, find lots of useful information with links pointing to related resources directly in the interface in the form of tooltips. Please pay attention to the question marks in the interface.

## Building a corpus

The ELEXIS tool used for building corpora is Sketch Engine [www.sketchengine.eu](http://www.sketchengine.eu). Sketch Engine has a built-in module allowing the user to build their own corpora without the need for any specific technical or IT knowledge. Any user with a general computer skills is able to use the module and build corpora successfully.

The module supports two main approaches:

- building a corpus from the data that the user has (documents, texts, papers, articles in electronic format) 
- building corpus by having Sketch Engine download specific pages or websites from the web or even having Sketch Engine search for the relevant content first and then download it.

A corpus can be built by either method and even by combining both methods.
