The course will introduce corpus tools available in ELEXIS and describe various ways in which they can be exploited in lexicographic research and for compiling dictionaries. At the end of the course, students will be able to build corpora, as well as evaluate their quality and suitability for the respective lexicographic task. Students will also acquire the skills necessary to work with the tools effectively to retrieve valid linguistic information from the corpus. Practical examples will simulate the use of these tools in the lexicographic workflow.
