Although the mapping of science is broadly interested in representing scholarly knowledge, its use is often related to bibliometric techniques such as citation analysis. This presentation brings back the science mapping to its original meaning by widening its context to arts and humanities with the help of design. By refocusing the final user to scientists themselves and the general public looking at science, the audience is conducted through a series of data visualisations that present scholarly knowledge through immersive architectures in digital and public spaces. In a study related to experimental museology, the idea is to take out science from the laboratory and make its structure and dynamics visible again for all of us.
