This session outlines the entire workflow of humanities research projects utilising ATR to extract full text from scanned images. We provide an overview of each step in the process and introduce subsequent tutorials that delve deeper into these steps. Additionally, a ‘How to get started with ATR’ road map linked in the source will guide you through important questions and give you basic orientation before starting an ATR project.

You can read the blogpost (available in English, French, and German), and watch our video (with subtitles in English, French, and German) embedded in the post.
