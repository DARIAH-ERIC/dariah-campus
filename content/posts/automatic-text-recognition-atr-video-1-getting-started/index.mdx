This session outlines the entire workflow of humanities research projects utilising ATR to extract full text from scanned images. We provide an overview of each step in the process and introduce subsequent tutorials that delve deeper into these steps. Additionally, a ‘How to get started with ATR’ road map linked in the source will guide you through important questions and give you basic orientation before starting an ATR project.

You can read the blogpost (available in English, French, and German), and watch our video (with subtitles in English, French, and German) embedded in the post.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- Identify the components of the ATR workflow relevant to humanities research.
- Understand the basic principles and applications of Automatic Text Recognition.
- Prepare their journey through the ATR pipeline by using our roadmap "How to get started in ATR?"
- Prepare to integrate ATR technology into your research activities effectively.
