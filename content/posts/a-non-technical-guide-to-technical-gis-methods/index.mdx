## Introduction

Spatial work can be broken into two broad categories: analysis and visualization. As a slight oversimplification, analysis/analytical methods make it easier for a computer to understand something, while visualizations make it easier for people to understand things. Most projects use a mix of these two.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, learners will be able to:

- understand an array of spatial methods
- apply the knowledge of spatial methods in their research and analysis

## Spatial Methods

**Geocoding** is the process of taking a list of addresses/places and getting coordinates out of them. Think of it as the difference between someone telling you where they live and you plugging that into Google Maps. Both are representations of the same place, but only one shows that as a spot on a map.

**Georeferencing** is the process of lining up some form of printed map with its coordinates. It’s the digital version of sticking pins through a piece of paper to attach it to a globe. This is often used for historical work, as it is the way that old maps are lined up with new. Think of those tourists who you can see standing lost on a corner, holding a map up. The map is not wrong, they just do not know how their location lines up with the information they have. Georeferencing does the same thing for the computer: this spot coordinates with this one and so on.

**Flow Analysis** shows how water would flow over given terrain. This is useful for things like urban planning but can also be used to find archaeological sites where things might have been washed away in the past.

**Cluster Analysis** involves grouping data to show something meaningful. Do Swifties tend to live in the same areas? Do different parts of a city own different dogs? Look at clusters to find out!

**Visibility Analysis** is a broad category of methods that deal with what can or cannot be seen from a given spot. These tend to be quite intuitive. 

**Viewshed Analysis** is just a way of calculating the area (viewshed) that can be seen from a spot. It’s as simple as that: you cannot see past an obstacle, or behind a hill, so those things are not within the viewshed. This is a perfect example of something that can be done on a small scale by an individual just going to a spot and looking around. But to scale it up a computer becomes useful. Sure, one can see how much is visible from one rooftop - but what if they want to know which rooftop has the best view? This is used for things like figuring out locations to put watchtowers in the present as well as examining if a place could be hit with an arrow from a tower in the past.

I**ntervisibility Analysis** shows whether or not different places can see one another. Think of that scene in every medieval fantasy movie where someone lights a beacon and the camera zooms out and we see each beacon being lit down the line. The beacons need to be intervisible such that they form a connected chain.

**Least Cost Path Analysis** is about finding the easiest way between points. If you’re out for a hike, you’re not going to want to go straight up or down, even if those are technically shorter routes. If it’s a multi-day trip, you’ll need to get water at some points too. The “cost” of a path can account for pretty much anything - avoiding Sun in the desert, nasty currents on the ocean, or enemy patrols. As long as it can be put into a map as a quantity, it can be calculated as part of a least cost path.

There are lots!

## Conclusion

Whether the goal of a researcher's spatial work is analysis or visualization, there are various methods to complete GIS related tasks.  It is up to the researcher to determine the type of method to apply.  Feel free to return to this resource as a reference when deciding on your own methodology.
