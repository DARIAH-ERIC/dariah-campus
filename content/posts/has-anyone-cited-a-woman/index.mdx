For many researchers, citation is an important way of demonstrating our knowledge, acknowledging the sources of our ideas, and connecting with debates in our fields. Recent studies have highlighted the systematic under-citation of women and other marginalised groups in various fields.

In this talk, Sally discusses recent activities undertaken at Maastricht University to help students and colleagues develop tactics to address this problem.

This webinar was presented on Friday 7th October as part of DARIAH's "Friday Frontiers' webinar series.
