We live in a distributed data world with ubiquitous computing. This is wonderful but it also comes at a price. The price is flexibility or - in other words - letting go of the idea that you as the creator own the interface. Publishing your product on the web means you need to consider a lot of different use cases and user needs you may not even know about. 

In this closing keynote at the DARIAH Virtual Annual Event 2021, Chris Heilmann, Principal PM for developer tools at Microsoft, is going to cover lots of scenarios he had to cover in the 25 years of building products for people on the web and what benefits it had to let go. 

The keynote was recorded on September 9, 2021, at the DARIAH Virtual Annual Event 2021.
