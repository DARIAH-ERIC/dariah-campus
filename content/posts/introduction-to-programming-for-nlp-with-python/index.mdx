  The aim of this virtual course is to offer basic knowledge and skills in
  programming in Python. Target audiences are undergraduate and graduate
  students in the Humanities and Social Sciences who want to acquire hands-on
  knowledge and skills in working with language data. No previous programming
  experience is required, but some elementary knowledge and skills in the
  practical use of your computer, keyboard, web browser and file system, as well
  as some basal knowledge of linguistics and mathematics, are presupposed.


  The core of the course consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks that combine examples of Python code with explanatory text. The notebooks provide demonstrations of simple language processing and the aggregation and visualization of qualitative and quantitative data, including data from real language research, from CLARINO, and from other sources. They also suggest exercises which should solvable on the basis of the given examples and explanations. Ideally, the course should be presented by a teacher and the exercises should be supervised, but the modules are also suitable for self-study.
