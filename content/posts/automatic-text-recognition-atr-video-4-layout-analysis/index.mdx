abstract: Discover how computers perform layout analysis in our fourth ATR
  tutorial video. This video explains how Automatic Text Recognition technology
  identifies the structural elements of a document and localises text lines,
  processes also known as segmentation, zoning, or document analysis. Gain
  insights into optical layout analysis, essential for efficiently processing
  and understanding heritage texts with ATR.
