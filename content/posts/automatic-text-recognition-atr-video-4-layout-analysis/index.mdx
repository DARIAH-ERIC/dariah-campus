abstract: "Discover how computers perform layout analysis in our fourth ATR
  tutorial. This tutorial (blogpost and video) explains how Automatic Text
  Recognition technology identifies the structural elements of a document and
  localises text lines, processes also known as segmentation, zoning, or
  document analysis. Gain insights into optical layout analysis, essential for
  efficiently processing and understanding heritage texts with ATR. "

## Learning Outcome

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- Distinguish between different methods of layout analysis including zoning and segmentation.
- Utilise software tools to perform optical layout analysis effectively.
- Analyse the structural elements of a document to facilitate accurate text extraction.
- Configure ATR systems to recognise and process various document layouts.

You can read the blogpost (available in English, French, and German), and watch our video (with subtitles in English, French, and German) embedded in the post.
