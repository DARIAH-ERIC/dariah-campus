abstract: This lesson provides a beginner-friendly introduction to convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. The tutorial provides a
  conceptual understanding of how neural networks work by using Googleâ€™s
  Teachable Machine to train a model on paintings from the ArtUK database. This
  lesson also demonstrates how to use Javascript to embed the model in a live
  website.

This lesson provides a beginner-friendly introduction to convolutional neural networks, which along with transformers, are frequently-used machine learning models for image classification. Neural networks develop their own idiosyncratic ways of seeing and often fail to separate features in the ways we might expect. Understanding how these networks operate provides us with a way to explore their limitations when programmed to identify images they have not been trained to recognize.

In this tutorial, we will train a convolutional neural network to classify paintings. As historians, we can use these models to analyze which topics recur most often over time, or automate the creation of metadata for a database. In contrast to other resources that focus on developing the most accurate model, the goal of this lesson is more modest. It is aimed at those wanting to gain an understanding of the basic terminology and makeup of neural networks so that they can expand their knowledge later, rather than those seeking to create production-level models from the outset.
