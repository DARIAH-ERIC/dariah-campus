  This is a record of a webinar dedicated to the phase of the research life cycle “Plan Research Project”. It first introduces the participants to an understanding of the advantages and practicalities of research collaboration in and with Research infrastructures. It then dives into details of project planning, touches upon the basics of the FAIR principles, and focuses especially on the importance of using standards in Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage research and how to identify relevant standards for the participants’ own research. This webinar gives an introduction to the Standards Survival Kit that is developed within PARTHENOS. It also cross-links to other materials developed within PARTHENOS and by the PARTHENOS Cluster Partners.
