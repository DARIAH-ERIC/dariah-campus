  This course provides participants with a comprehensive understanding of
  cultural heritage data modelling, emphasising the principles essential for
  structuring and documenting information within the context of cultural
  heritage institutions such as  libraries, archives, and museums. It provides
  the skills to represent information using entities and relationships, while
  utilising metadata standards commonly used in the domain. It highlights the
  significance of understanding the structure of the data model not only for
  reusing data, but also for exploring and reusing metadata. The course
  specifically delves into the Europeana Data Model (EDM), a key framework for
  organising and describing cultural heritage data, and also demonstrates its
  capacity to describe data collected for research purposes using as an example
  the use cases introduced in course “Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data”. 


  Learning Outcomes


  Upon completion of this course, participants will:

  - understand the basic principles of data modeling, and the importance of knowing the structure of data models, particularly for reusing metadata;

  - know what metadata are, including the metadata standards commonly used in cultural heritage institutions, and understand their significance in data reuse;

  - be able to represent knowledge about a domain using entities and relationships;

  - understand the structure of the Europeana Data Model (EDM) and its role in effective metadata management, and be able to model/document information resources based on the EDM structure.

# Introduction

Fundamental in the process of collecting, structuring and documenting Cultural Heritage (CH) data is the way we formulate them. It is very important to follow methodologies and select common frameworks for their formulation that enable both humans and machines to understand the available information without ambiguities and support reasoning about this information. To illustrate this, we take the use case of Prof. Lorena, a Professor of Social History in the Department of History who specialises in the analysis of migration patterns, with a particular focus on treatment of refugees in Europe. With many years of experience, Prof. Lorena is well aware of the importance of information modelling. She consistently emphasises this in her lectures and when supervising her students. 

In this course, we will follow Prof. Lorena as she guides Costis, a masters student, who has already acquired data from the [Europeana portal](https://www.europeana.eu/) and various cultural heritage institutions’ websites related to the Hungarian Revolution and migration patterns, as discussed in course "Introduction to Cultural Heritage Data". Additionally, Costis is also requested to integrate other data coming from Prof. Lorena’s previous research on the topic, to this dataset. He faces the challenge of formulating and integrating data that come from different sources and that use different structures.
