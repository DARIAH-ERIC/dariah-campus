This webinar is part of the TRIPLE Open Science Training Series.

The training session is dedicated to the EOSC Architecture and is presented by Ville Tenhunen, Data Solutions Architect at the EGI Foundation.

Ville Tenhunen first presents the EOSC and its ongoing developments. He provides an overview of the EOSC Architecture principles, the EOSC Future guiding principles and the Minimum Viable EOSC. The main components of the EOSC Architecture are then introduced, along with a detailed view of its layers. Ville Tenhunen describes the components of the EOSC Architecture and more specifically EOSC Core, EOSC Exchange, EOSC Support Activities and the EOSC Interoperability Framework. He explains the scope and purpose of the EOSC Interoperability Framework and its importance in federating the services that will compose the EOSC. The problems encountered on the way to achieving technical, semantic, organizational and legal interoperability are highlighted and recommendations are presented for each aspect. Finally, the speaker introduces the requirements to become a service provider in the EOSC, such as for example the obligation for services to be accessible to users outside of their original community.
