Not familiar with knowledge organisation? It provides the foundation for searching and retrieving arts and humanities information objects across digital collections and cultural heritage information systems. This course will give you introductory knowledge about knowledge organisation systems and professional subject indexing, social tagging as another approach to knowledge organisation, and automatic subject indexing as the third approach to knowledge organisation. 

\
Starting from the case studies analysed in the course, you will be able to transfer the knowledge obtained to any digital humanities context anywhere in the world.
