## Workshop Abstract

Challenged by urbanization, economy, gentrification, migration, and climate change the experience of historical spaces and buildings is fragmented, thus mirroring the disconnected perception of urban societies. This Dariah workshop studied how urban heritage and the abundance of culturally valuable structures in historic cities across Europe can contribute to reflective processes and the creation of legible, inclusive, accessible, resilient and enjoyable cities. 

### _**Learning Objectives**_

_**Participatory Design:**_ Learn how community-building projects can engage local stakeholders, pull insights from diverse perspectives, and influence urban redevelopment authorities. 

_**Urban Theory:**_ Hear state-of-the-art approaches to sustainable heritage, with reflections from experienced architects, academics, and urban thinkers. More specifically, critical issues of urban gentrification, place-making, and the pressures faced by historic urban neighbourhoods in Southern Europe.

_**Information-Communication Technology:**_ See tools deployed for rapid 3D reconstruction, documentation, and urban codesign with non-experts. We specifically explore photogrammetry, gamification, and augmented reality as a possible solutions to scalable public outreach.

Data collection and co-creation was facilitated by the use of citizen volunteered geolocation software (readily available to the participants by the organisers), such as DEUSTO Tech [DARIAH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobility.deustotech.dariah_android) app. A separate mobile augented-reality app, [WIKAR](http://wikar.co/), was used to facilitate a participatory project development processes. With this tool, workshop participants could visualize various project proposals directly projected in the real spaces subject of the project through their iOS and Android mobile devices.
