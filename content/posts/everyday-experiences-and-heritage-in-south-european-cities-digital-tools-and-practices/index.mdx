abstract: >-
  Learn how community-building projects can engage local stakeholders, pull
  meaningful insights from diverse perspectives, and influence urban
  redevelopment authorities.


  See technologies deployed for rapid 3D reconstruction, documentation, and codesign with non-experts. We specifically explore augmented reality as a possible solution to public access. 


  Hear about state-of-the-art theories and approaches to sustainable heritage, with reflections from experienced architects, academics, and urban thinkers. More specifically, critical issues of urban gentrification, place-making, and the pressures faced by historic urban neighbourhoods in Southern Europe.

On Monday, July 26th, the Order of Architects of Palermo participated in the DARIAH Workshop on applications developed by DARIAH Workgroup in cooperation with university research partners. 
In particular, DARIAH presented and discussed the app WIKAR, developed by Colter Wehmeier from the University of Illinois. WIKAR uses AR technologies to facilitate participatory project development processes. The workshop participants could visualize in a digital environment various project proposals directly projected in the real spaces subject of the project through IOS/Android mobile devices.
