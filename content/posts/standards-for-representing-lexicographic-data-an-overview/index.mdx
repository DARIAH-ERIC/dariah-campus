This course is intended for trainees. It focuses on the importance of standards to facilitate the cooperation among lexicographers in a multilingual and multicultural context by addressing a relevant de facto standards such as Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), TEI Lex-0, models such as OntoLex-Lemon, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards such as _Presentation/representation of entries in dictionaries – Requirements, recommendations and information_ or ISO 1951 (2007) and _Lexical markup framework_ (LMF) or ISO 24613 (2019, 2020, 2021).

The most widely used standards and models in the lexicographic community will be approached according to their aims:

1. those dealing with linguistic content (e.g. LMF); 
2. those that are used for annotation purposes (e.g. TEI); 
3. those that handle representation purposes (e.g. OntoLex Lemon); 
4. those addressing interoperability issues (e.g. OntoLex Lemon). 

At the end of the course, students will be familiar with the principles and procedures involved in writing, editing, or compiling dictionaries, considering standards in different parts of their lexicographic workflows.[^1]

[^1]: For more information, see _D1.2 Best practises for lexicography – intermediate report_, 31.01.2020 (Tiberius et al., 2020).

This course is divided into two main parts.

In Part 1, Standards and Formats, we describe the standards and the formats we use in this document in order to become familiar with the best practises for representing lexical data. The use of the same example from different language dictionaries, the lexicographic article ‘fly’, will illustrate the uses of these standards and models.

In Part 2, we propose a core vocabulary that defines the minimal set of concepts necessary for lexicographic work. The main objective is to present the formal and natural language definitions of the core concepts, putting them side by side, to facilitate the understanding to a larger community dealing with dictionaries, traditional lexicographers, but also NLP and ontology communities. The set of definitions is expressed by resorting to context-free grammar and to ISO 704 (2009) best practices such as the UML notation for defining concepts  or ISO 24156-1 (2014).

**Learning outcomes**

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- appreciate the importance of the standards for the lexicographic work; 
- understand the purpose of the diversity of the standards;
- know the different formats used for interoperability matters;
- apply the standards to the digital dictionary-making; 
- understand how to model a dictionary entry in different standards;
- prepare data for operationalization needs;
- apply the acquired knowledge to concrete examples.
