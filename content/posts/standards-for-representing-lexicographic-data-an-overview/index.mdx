This course will impress upon students the importance of shared standards for the productive cooperation among lexicographers in a multicultural and multilingual context by referring to a number of lexicographically relevant standards such as TEI, TEI Lex-0, ISO 1951, ISO 24613 (LMF), OntoLex-Lemon etc. The relevant standards will be classified according to their aims (those dealing with linguistic content; those that are used for annotation purposes; those that handle representation purposes; those addressing interoperability issues etc.).

 At the end of the course, students will be able to conduct dictionary research and work with dictionaries, taking into account standards in different parts of their lexicographic workflows.

## Learning Outcomes

- appreciate the importance of the standards for the lexicographical work; 
- understand the purpose of the diversity of the standards;
- know the different formats used for interoperability matters;
- apply the standards to the digital dictionary-making; 
- understand how to model a dictionary entry in different standards;
- prepare data for operationalization needs;
- apply the acquired knowledge to concrete examples.
