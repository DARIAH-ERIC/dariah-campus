This resource offers an introduction to copyright within the UK context when dealing with multidimensional media. It introduces the UK context for copyright, which is a legal right, protecting the copyright owner and/or the creator of a work giving them control over their work and how it is used.  Learners are presented with information that has been gathered from a mixture of web resources, references and links, including the British Library, JISC, and Creative Commons.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, learners will be able to:

- Outline the ways in which creative works, in particular images and visual material, are protected in the context of copyright law in the UK.
- Understand and discuss the impact of the copyright legislation on personal practice for collecting multidimensional data.
- Compare the types of licenses available to protect and use creative works.
- Trial and give examples of Creative Commons licenses that could be applied to their own work.
