This course will present an overview of resources available from CLARIN that may be useful for the lexicographer; we refer to  lexical datasets but also to textual resources such as corpora, as well as tools..  

We will start from a brief outline of the CLARIN infrastructures and of its centres. Then we will show how to deposit your lexical resource in a CLARIN centre for visibility, citability, versioning and long term preservation.  We will highlight links and references with other modules in the course as concerns the paradigm of Open Data and formats and standards to represent lexical data.

We will then give an overview of the resources available from the CLARIN infrastructure, by browsing the CLARIN Virtual Language Observatory and  the CLARIN resource families, in particular the ones dedicated to Lexica and Dictionaries. We will illustrate the metadata used for describing these resources and the differences in terms of formats and accessibility . 

We will conclude with an exploration of some of the TOOLS present in the CLARIN Switchboard which can be used for lexicographic purposes.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- appreciate importance of FAIR and Open data and the role of research infrastructures to ensure that lexical data is correctly preserved
- deposit their lexical resource on a CLARIN DSPACE type of repository (such as ILC4CLARIN), with the appropriate metadata, understand the versioning of resources, cite their resource appropriately
- search for and locate existing lexical resource within the CLARIN infrastructure (VLO, Resource Families)
- create a simple lexical resource by means of LexO, a collaborative editor of OntoLex-Lemon resources 
- build a simple lexical resource (in TEI) with the [\<TEI>\enricher](https://howto.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/de/resource/posts/a-very-concise-guide-to-creating-lexical-resources-with-%CB%82tei%CB%83enricher)
