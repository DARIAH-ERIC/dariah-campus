abstract: "Join us in our third ATR tutorial where we delve into the critical
  process of image optimisation for Automatic Text Recognition. This tutorial
  (blogpost and video) covers the scanning process, essential considerations for
  high-quality scans, and key pre-processing steps like cropping and dewarping.
  We also discuss common challenges encountered during the pre-processing stage
  of ATR, preparing you to handle them effectively. "
