abstract: Join us in our third ATR tutorial video where we delve into the
  critical process of image optimisation for Automatic Text Recognition. This
  video covers the scanning process, essential considerations for high-quality
  scans, and key pre-processing steps like cropping and dewarping. We also
  discuss common challenges encountered during the pre-processing stage of ATR,
  preparing you to handle them effectively.
