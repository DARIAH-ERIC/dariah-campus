Prof. Dan O'Donnell (University of Lethbridge) discusses the CARE principles, how they sit alongside the FAIR Principles, and how (digital) humanists can apply them in their research. He presents examples from his own research, particularly around studies of historical artefacts in small rural communities in Scotland.

The [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care) were drawn up to ensure the rights and dignity of indigenous people all over the world are respected in the course of scholarship. They ensure the **C**ollective benefit, **A**uthority to control data, **R**esponsibility to the communities, and **E**thics in research. They were drafted at the International Data Week and Research Data Alliance Plenary co-hosted event “Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles for the Governance of Indigenous Data Workshop,” 8 November 2018, Gaborone, Botswana.

Dan's presentation was delivered as part of DARIAH-EU's 'Friday Frontiers' In-House Webinar series in October 2021.
