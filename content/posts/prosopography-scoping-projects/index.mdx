abstract: Scoping prosopography projects includes consideration of research
  questions, boundaries of what other researchers can find in your work and
  methods to keep your work manageable. This resource will help students to
  define those characteristics and ensure their scale and scope is manageable
  and appropriate when applying their prosopography skills to new
  projects.  Upon completion of this resource, students should have a concept of
  how to set boundaries on prosopography projects.

Scoping Notes

The scope of a project, as we’re defining it for this class, is basically the

answer to the question “who gets into your club”? As a prosopographer, you

have a range of people and characters available in your source material, but

you need to set some sort of boundaries to your project. There are three

main reasons for setting out a formal scope:



1. It tells other people what they can find in your database.

a. This is extremely important for making databases other people

can subsequently use – they need to know on what basis people

get into your database, so they know how much the filter of

people for their project overlaps with that.



2. It makes your project manageable in scale and planning.

a. Without any kinds of limits or boundaries, a prosopography can

extend almost infinitely – you need to be able to plan the work

you can feasibly do, or at least plan a set of meaningful units of

work.



3. It interacts with your research questions

a. You make databases of people, in general, for a reason: you

want to use them. But how you can best use them is highly

dependent on what they actually do and don’t contain. The most

important question here is whether you’re aiming to model a

period or space of history, or index or discuss a particular

source or set of sources.



Aiming to model history via prosopography, for example, might include

questions like “how able were widows among the late medieval merchant

class in Frankfurt to control their estates after their husbands’ death?”, or

“were factions in the Carthaginan state bound together by shared

commercial interests?” or “to what extent were non-Chinese generals or

officials able to rise to high social rank under the T’ang dynasty?”1 In these

questions, the aim of the prosopography is to use a collection of person data

to examine the actions of historical actors. This in turn means that

producing the most complete view possible of a person is important – the

database needs to be as accurate a description of what the scholar thinks

actually happened as possible.

Prosopographical indexes of bodies of source material serve different

functions to databases that act as historical models, despite potentially

looking nominally similar. In these cases, the aim is to index a particular

document, and cleave more closely to the original text. This is useful for

general purpose databases, for the following reasons:

 Documentation that attempts to include all relevant material, or at

least enough to produce a full model of what was happening, is more

labour intensive to produce by far. Indexing just requires a scholar to

 Nb I have no idea what the answer to these questions is or if source material exists for them! 

make the usually less controversial statement of “this text says thing

X and is referring to object Y” without the extra jump of “and I think X

is/is not what actually happened”.

 It allows sources with different language requirements to be handled

in a more separate – and thus more effectively specialised – manner,

thereby potentially improving the quality of the overall work.

 It may allow the data to be closer to the source with less historical

analysis added in, making it more useful for scholars who want an

index of people in a given text, or want to be able to look at the

material without another prior scholar’s conceptions.

 It makes it easier to look at how the author of a specific text presented

people – being thereby more useful for work on narratives and

historical textual work.

In practice, the division between index and model is not as neat as has been

presented here. Many projects have a limited source range but can still be

used for modelling projects, for example the People of Medieval Scotland

database does not use the major narrative sources, but in allowing access to

a wide range of tagged legal documents can provide a basis for meaningful

analyses of action via looking at connections and signatories. The above

division will nonetheless be useful to be getting on with, and we’ll return to

it later in much more detail.

This division of research questions helps inform what parameters you use to

define your scope. These can broadly be split into two categories, which tend

towards, whilst not necessarily mapping neatly onto, the above division of

database type and research question. Firstly there are scope boundaries

that are created by textual features, and secondly there are those that are

created by historical features.

The former category, textual scoping, defines “entry to the club” by

questions about texts and sources – does the person appear in a particular

source or type of source, or do they appear in a certain language group’s

body of sources? Here are two examples or criteria:

 Source – Whilst any database will need a list of sources consulted,

some databases are primarily attempts to work with a certain source

or type of source. For example some may be prosopographical

databases of epigraphy (that is, inscriptions) or legal texts like

charters, or will focus on a particular author’s works.

 Language – Many areas of history have source material from a

number of different language groups available. For indexing, division

by language can be sensible to allow specialists on different language

areas an angle to work on their material.

The latter category, historical scoping, defines “entry to the club” by

questions about the people under discussion – where they were, when they

were, and who they were. This is more necessary for modelling questions

where the scholar is more keen to test questions about a specific group of 

people and the society and world they lived in. A non-exhaustive list of

categories follows:

 Chronology – relatively self explanatory, setting dated bounds for the

project.

 Space – setting a spatial bound. This and the chronology bound may

apply within records as well as to entire people. For example, a

prosopography of C13 China might include Marco Polo, but might not

want to include in detail notes on his travels around Italy and western

Asia which fall well beyond the scope of the project.

 Role – for example, only people with particular offices are included, or

people in a particular faction or grouping. Beard’s analysis of the

members of the US constitutional convention is an example here.

 Identity – for example, only people with a certain ethnicity, gender,

race, sexuality, etc, are included. This functions somewhat similarly to

the role category in some ways, excepting that identity is often written

about in more oblique ways.

 Connection – if one particular figure is at the core of the study, the

category could be people with known connections to that person. The

difficulty of this sort of category is that it requires more circular

working – one may for example need to produce the data and then

refine it after doing analyses of the networks involved.

Of course all of these categories may have edge cases, and one of the

difficulties is working out where to draw the line and making oneself rules

for where to do so, as you may find out during data productions. One

notable feature of historical scoping is that it often requires more historical

judgement, as for example ethnic terminology is not usually applied

consistently in historical sources, and may well be left out especially for

common cases (so a medieval Irish text for example won’t repeatedly tell you

that every character is Irish as they’re introduced, that’s just an assumed

normal).

These scoping features, including both textual and historical categories, can

and usually are combined, and the neat distinction drawn here will break

down to a noticeable extent. There are some areas where it is rare for

scholars to actually be able to consult all the extant material, so even if the

scope is not nominally textual, clarity on which sources were incorporated

into the project is a necessity. Meanwhile in textual-scope databases there

are often still some limitations on inclusion – many medieval chronicles have

starting sections that give a brief summary of events from the creation to the

main point of the chronicle, or insert analogies and stories about classical

heroes, which means a chronology requirement can be useful to avoid Adam

and Eve needing to be detailed in every database.

One way of summarising a lot of these rules and how to think about them

practically is the Richard the Lionheart Problem. Richard I of England had

a varied career that involved stretches in England, France, Cyprus,

Outremer, and Austria, among others. So if someone made a prosopography 

of medieval Cyprus, how much about Richard should they include? How

meaningful, on the other hand, would it be useful to produce a source-based

prosopography that tried to follow Richard through a narrative of his life,

with his movements connecting people from the court in London to Saladin’s

military camps in the Holy Land? There’s no “right answer” to these

questions, they’re dependent on what you’re trying to do with the data.
