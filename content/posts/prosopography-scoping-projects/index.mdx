## Introduction

In this resource, you will begin to understand the importance of scoping prosopography projects. This resource will help in learners to form scope based on their research questions, and other key factors. This resource will help researchers ensure their scale and scope is manageable and appropriate when applying their prosopography skills to new projects. By clearly defining the scope, researchers can streamline their efforts, focus on relevant data, and produce meaningful and impactful results.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this resource, students should be able to:

- Set effective boundaries on prosopography projects
- Gain the ability to delineate clear and precise project parameters
- Ensure that their research is both focused and comprehensive

## Scoping a Project

The scope of a project, as we’re defining it for this class, is basically the answer to the question “who gets into your club”? In other words, it defines the criteria for inclusion and exclusion within your prosopography database. As a prosopographer, you have a range of people and characters available in your source material, but you need to set some sort of boundaries to your project. These boundaries help maintain focus and ensure the project remains feasible and aligned with your research goals.

There are three main reasons for setting out a formal scope:

1.  It tells other people what they can find in your database.

This is extremely important for making databases other people can subsequently use – they need to know on what basis people get into your database, so they know how much the filter of people for their project overlaps with that. Clear scope definitions enhance the utility and accessibility of your database for other researchers.

2.  It makes your project manageable in scale and planning.

Without any kinds of limits or boundaries, a prosopography can extend almost infinitely – you need to be able to plan the work you can feasibly do, or at least plan a set of meaningful units of work. Defining the scope ensures that the project is achievable within available resources and timeframes.

3.  It interacts with your research questions.

You make databases of people, in general, for a reason: you want to use them. But how you can best use them is highly dependent on what they actually do and don’t contain. The most important question here is whether you’re aiming to model a period or space of history, or index or discuss a particular source or set of sources. The scope should align with and support your specific research objectives, ensuring relevance and depth in your findings.

### Scoping Questions

Aiming to model history via prosopography, for example, might include questions like:

- “How able were widows among the late medieval merchant class in Frankfurt to control their estates after their husbands’ death?”
- “Were factions in the Carthaginian state bound together by shared commercial interests?”
- “To what extent were non-Chinese generals or officials able to rise to high social rank under the T’ang dynasty?"

In these questions, the aim of the prosopography is to use a collection of person data to examine the actions of historical actors. This in turn means that producing the most complete view possible of a person is important – the database needs to be as accurate a description of what the scholar thinks actually happened as possible. Comprehensive and accurate data collection is essential for meaningful analysis and conclusions.

### Prosopographical Indexing

Prosopographical indexes of bodies of source material serve different functions to databases that act as historical models, despite potentially looking nominally similar. In these cases, the aim is to index a particular document, and cleave more closely to the original text.

Prosopographical Indexes are useful for general purpose databases, for the following reasons:

**Documentation that attempts to include all relevant material, or at least enough to produce a full model of what was happening, is more labour intensive to produce by far.** 

- Documentation that attempts to include all relevant material, or at least enough to produce a full model of what was happening, is more labor-intensive to produce by far.
- Indexing just requires a scholar to say "I have no idea what the answer to these questions is or if source material exists for them!" and make the usually less controversial statement of “this text says thing X and is referring to object Y” without the extra jump of “and I think X is/is not what actually happened”.
- It allows sources with different language requirements to be handled in a more separate – and thus more effectively specialized – manner. This specialization can improve the quality and accuracy of the work.
- It may allow the data to be closer to the source with less historical analysis added in. This will make it more useful for scholars who want an index of people in a given text, or want to be able to look at the material without another prior scholar’s conceptions.
- It makes it easier to look at how the author of a specific text presented people. This will mean it is thereby more useful for work on narratives and historical textual work.

In practice, the division between index and model is not as neat as has been presented here. Many projects have a limited source range but can still be used for modelling projects. For example, the People of Medieval Scotland database does not use the major narrative sources, but in allowing access to a wide range of tagged legal documents can provide a basis for meaningful analyses of action via looking at connections and signatories.

The above division will nonetheless be useful to be getting on with, and we’ll return to it later in much more detail. This division of research questions helps inform what parameters you use to define your scope. These can broadly be split into two categories, which tend towards, whilst not necessarily mapping neatly onto, the above division of database type and research question. Firstly there are scope boundaries that are created by textual features, and secondly there are those that are created by historical features.

##### Examples

The former category, textual scoping, defines “entry to the club” by questions about texts and sources – does the person appear in a particular source or type of source, or do they appear in a certain language group’s body of sources?  This type of scoping focuses on the nature and characteristics of the source material itself.

Here are two examples of criteria:

**Source**

- Whilst any database will need a list of sources consulted,some databases are primarily attempts to work with a certain source or type of source. For example some may be prosopographical databases of epigraphy (that is, inscriptions) or legal texts like charters, or will focus on a particular author’s works.

**Language**

- Many areas of history have source material from a number of different language groups available. For indexing, division by language can be sensible to allow specialists on different language areas an angle to work on their material.

The latter category, historical scoping, defines “entry to the club” by questions about the people under discussion – where they were, when they were, and who they were. This is more necessary for modelling questions where the scholar is more keen to test questions about a specific group of people and the society and world they lived in. 

A non-exhaustive list of categories for scoping is as follows:

**Chronology**

- Relatively self explanatory, setting dated bounds for the project.

**Space**

- Setting a spatial bound. This and the chronology bound may apply within records as well as to entire people. For example, a prosopography of C13 China might include Marco Polo, but might not want to include in detail notes on his travels around Italy and western Asia which fall well beyond the scope of the project.

**Role** 

- For example, only people with particular offices are included, or people in a particular faction or grouping. Beard’s analysis of the members of the US constitutional convention is an example here.

**Identity**

- For example, only people with a certain ethnicity, gender, race, sexuality, etc, are included. This functions somewhat similarly to the role category in some ways, excepting that identity is often written about in more oblique ways.

**Connection**

- If one particular figure is at the core of the study, the category could be people with known connections to that person. The difficulty of this sort of category is that it requires more circular working – one may for example need to produce the data and then refine it after doing analyses of the networks involved.

Of course all of these categories may have edge cases, and one of the difficulties is working out where to draw the line and making oneself rules for where to do so, as you may find out during data productions. One notable feature of historical scoping is that it often requires more historical judgement, as for example ethnic terminology is not usually applied consistently in historical sources, and may well be left out especially for common cases (so a medieval Irish text for example won’t repeatedly tell you that every character is Irish as they’re introduced, that’s just an assumed normal).

#### Combining Scoping Features

These scoping features, including both textual and historical categories, can and usually are combined, and the neat distinction drawn here will break down to a noticeable extent. There are some areas where it is rare for scholars to actually be able to consult all the extant material, so even if the scope is not nominally textual, clarity on which sources were incorporated into the project is a necessity. Meanwhile in textual-scope databases there are often still some limitations on inclusion – many medieval chronicles have starting sections that give a brief summary of events from the creation to the main point of the chronicle, or insert analogies and stories about classical heroes, which means a chronology requirement can be useful to avoid Adam and Eve needing to be detailed in every database.

### The Richard the Lionheart Problem

One way of summarizing a lot of these rules and how to think about them practically is the Richard the Lionheart Problem. Richard I of England had a varied career that involved stretches in England, France, Cyprus, Outremer, and Austria, among others. His extensive travels and varied engagements present a unique challenge in defining the scope of a prosopography project.

So, if someone made a prosopography of medieval Cyprus, how much about Richard should they include? Should they focus solely on his activities in Cyprus, or should they also consider his broader influence and interactions across Europe and the Middle East? How meaningful, on the other hand, would it be to produce a source-based prosopography that tried to follow Richard through a narrative of his life, with his movements connecting people from the court in London to Saladin’s military camps in the Holy Land? There’s no “right answer” to these questions; they’re dependent on what you’re trying to do with the data.

## Conclusion

Throughout this resource, readers should have learned how to form effective boundaries for their prosopography projects using scoping questions and prosopography indexing. By clearly defining the scope, researchers can create focused, manageable, and meaningful prosopography projects that align with their research goals.

Scoping a project is essential in ensuring that the research remains feasible and relevant, allowing scholars to produce high-quality, impactful work. With a well-defined scope, researchers can better navigate the complexities of their source material, make informed decisions about inclusion and exclusion, and ultimately contribute valuable insights to the field of prosopography.
