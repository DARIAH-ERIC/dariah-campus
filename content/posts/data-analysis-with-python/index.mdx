abstract: This course from dariahTeach introduces learners to the theoretical
  and practical foundations of an analysis of socio-cultural objects using
  Python through theoretical grounding and hands-on case studies.  Students will
  work through several research use cases using basic machine learning, and
  employ network analysis to split a small community network into groups and
  clusters before finally learning more about visualisation and image analysis.

Analytics has a strong tradition, very established methods, and a broad range of applications in culture, economy, and society. Social media analytics extends general analytics toward analysing social (media) relationships. Cultural analytics builds on successful analytical methods and applies its techniques and methods to studying cultural objects.

In this course, you will learn about the theoretical and practical foundations of an analysis of socio-cultural objects. While experimenting, you will also learn about the limits of the current capacities and the exciting opportunities.

## L﻿earning Outcomes

A﻿fter completing this course, learners will be able to:

- w﻿rite basic Python 
- u﻿nderstand and implement techniques of data analysis using Python
- a﻿pply analytical techniques to a case study to develop visualisations
