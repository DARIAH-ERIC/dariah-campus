Design thinking is much less about knowing and much more about doing. Donald Schön, in his groundbreaking work on design (1984, 1992), demonstrated that knowing is in the activity of designing, and that the two cannot be separated. The focus in this course is on the practical aspects of design thinking, offering the tools and methods for students and researchers to apply the principles of design thinking when facing problems of their own. Note that the course [Introduction to Design Thinking and Maker Culture](https://campus.dariah.eu/resource/posts/introduction-to-design-thinking-and-maker-culture) offers extensive information on design thinking and makers culture as well. It offers most of all information on the ‘what’ and ‘why’. This course focuses above all on the ‘how’.
