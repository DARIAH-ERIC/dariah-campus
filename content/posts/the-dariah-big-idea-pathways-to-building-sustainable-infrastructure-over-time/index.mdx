Professor Jennifer Edmond, President of the Board of Directors of DARIAH-EU, presents pathways to building sustainable infrastructure over time, future directions for DARIAH, the humanities and arts in Europe and beyond. She asks the audience to help DARIAH to think about what it means to be a European reseach infrastructure.

This lecture was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and 3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia, Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
