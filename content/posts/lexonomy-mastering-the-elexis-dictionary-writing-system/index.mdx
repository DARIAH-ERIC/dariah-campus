The course will explore how software tools for dictionary production (so-called dictionary writing systems, or DWS) can be used to streamline and facilitate the structural coherence and quality assurance in a dictionary project by focusing on Lexonomy, a dictionary-writing system developed as part of ELEXIS. At the end of this course the students will know how to use Lexonomy in various stages of the lexicographic workflow, from creating a dictionary, selecting a suitable data model, and setting up different configuration options, to using advanced features such as workflow monitoring, and preparing the dictionary for publication. Selected existing projects will be used as case studies.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- assess DWS in general
- create a dictionary in Lexonomy (monolingual and bilingual)
- set up different configuration options (including defining the entry structure)
- set up and use the Sketch Engine API for pulling data
- use advanced features such as workflow monitoring
- upload/download a dictionary
- prepare the dictionary for publication
- (link to other dictionaries)
