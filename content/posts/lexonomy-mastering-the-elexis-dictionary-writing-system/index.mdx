The course will explore how software tools for dictionary production (so-called dictionary writing systems, or DWS) can be used to streamline and facilitate the structural coherence and quality assurance in a dictionary project by focusing on Lexonomy, a dictionary-writing system developed as part of ELEXIS. At the end of this course, the students will know how to use Lexonomy in various stages of the lexicographic workflow, from creating a dictionary, selecting a suitable data model, and setting up different configuration options, to using advanced features such as workflow monitoring, and preparing the dictionary for publication. Selected existing projects will be used as case studies.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- assess DWS in general
- create a dictionary in Lexonomy (monolingual and bilingual)
- set up different configuration options (including defining the entry structure)
- set up and use the Sketch Engine API for pulling data
- use advanced features such as workflow monitoring
- upload/download a dictionary
- prepare the dictionary for publication
- (link to other dictionaries)

### Introduction

In this short course, we will first look into software-led dictionary creation through dictionary writing systems (DWS) in general, and with the use of Lexonomy more specifically. The course contains guidance on creating dictionaries in Lexonomy from scratch and from an automatically generated draft. Then, we focus on editing a dictionary in preparation for publication, and finally, we present \_\_\_\__, which serves as a case study to demonstrate several of the featured actions and what can be achieved.

- ### What is DWS

A dictionary writing system (DWS) is a type of specialised software used by lexicographers, publishers, researchers and individuals for compiling dictionaries and other lexical resources, such as a thesaurus, ontology, vocabulary, or a glossary. The topic of the current course, Lexonomy, is an "off the shelf" dictionary writing system. This means that the software is standardised, can be used immediately, and provides a broad range of features that a wide range of users will find useful. Other examples of such software are XML editors such as iLEX, TLex, IDM DPS, SDL MultiTerm, Xmetal and many more. However, many organisations use their own, dedicated DWS that had been developed exclusively for their purposes, and which are dependent on their own internal databases.

Generally, the main aim of a DWS is to provide an efficient, ergonomic and customisable dictionary writing platform, through which production time and costs can be reduced. Many of these software enable collaboration by sharing a central database that hosts the project in some way, for example, by using an online collaborative workspace.

- ### Introducing Lexonomy

Lexonomy is a free, cloud-based, open-source dictionary writing and publishing system that is part of the ELEXIS project infrastructure. It aims to provide an easy, standardised, straightforward platform for dictionary creation. The tool is highly scalable, so it can be used for large dictionary projects as well as small glossaries or terminology resources. Since its introduction in 2017, over 5000 dictionaries were created in Lexonomy by more than 2500 users, hosting more than 34 million entries. Lexonomy is compatible with Sketch Engine, enabling already existing dictionary data to be imported, edited, and published through Lexonomy.
