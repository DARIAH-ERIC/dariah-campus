This resource provides guidance on digital practices to curate interactive experiences through a set of practical exercises. The resource aims to support GLAM’s researchers and practitioners to engage with their audiences through the design of multimedia applications, while making use of appropriate frameworks and tools.

During the tutorial we will use established methods and frameworks to practice how to manage a digital exhibition/experience design project from the stage of its conception to the stage of its conceptualisation through a storyboard.

## **Learning Outcomes**

After completing this course, learners will:

- Manage a digital exhibition/experience project.
- Define users or target audiences through UX and visitor research methods.
- Design a storyboard for a multimedia interpretative application.
