This learning resource will provide an overview of the trending topics in computational lexicography ranging from automatic extraction of good examples and word-sense disambiguation to machine learning. The course will be aimed at developers who are new to lexicography and who quickly want to familiarize themselves with the most important literature and/or available learning resources which can bring them up to speed in the fast-changing field.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students/developers will be able to

- assess different tools used in the lexicographic workflow
- compare and evaluate different approaches to automatic extraction of lexicographic data (e.g. headword lists, collocations and example sentences)
- find the most important literature and/or available learning resources in computational lexicography
