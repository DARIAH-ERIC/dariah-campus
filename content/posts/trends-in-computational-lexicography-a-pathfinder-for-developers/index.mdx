This learning resource provides software developers and computational linguists with an overview of the typical  computational processing tasks and software tools in the lexicographic workflow. The resource introduces the most widely used custom developed tools for corpus-based lexicography as well as their functionality. Additionally, we give pointers to trending R&D topics in computational lexicography ranging from automatic extraction of good examples and word-sense disambiguation to machine learning. The course is aimed at developers and computational linguists who are new to lexicography and who quickly want to familiarise themselves with the most important literature and/or available learning resources which can bring them up to speed in the fast-changing field and prepare them to collaborate  in a multidisciplinary team of lexicographers, computational linguists and software developers. 

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

- assess different tools used in the lexicographic workflow
- understand the typical functions and custom features of lexicographic tools
- compare and evaluate different approaches to automatic extraction of lexicographic data (e.g. headword lists, collocations and example sentences)
- find the most important literature and/or available learning resources in computational lexicography
