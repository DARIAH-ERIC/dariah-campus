Culture is a phenomenon that is incredibly difficult to capture accurately. In most understandings, it is now referred to as a system of shared beliefs and values of a group of people. Amongst the rapid development of technology and the Internet, the term 'digital culture' has emerged, and it has begun to engulf people in a discourse on whether and how this kind of culture can lend itself to become a heritage. The following material is a basic introduction to this topic and aims to interest the viewer with the topic of digital cultures and heritages, as well as tells the truth about digital culture and heritage, and how they can work together.

Johanna Enqvist is a researcher in Constellations of Correspondence at the University of Helsinki, as well as a member of the Finnish Literature Society. She teaches digital heritage research at the university and is primarily interested in cultural studies, archaeology, as well as connecting that to digitalisation.
