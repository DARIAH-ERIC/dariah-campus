The goal of this course is to introduce a brief history of dictionaries as tools for the organization of knowledge about words and their meanings, and to analyze different ways of understanding and classifying the dictionary genre. In order to do so, the course will cover the constituent parts of a dictionary (macrostructure, microstructure and mediostructure) as well as different kinds of dictionary typologies, including those based on source and target languages (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual); types of language(s) and topic(s) covered (general language, encyclopedic, terminological); medium (print and electronic); semantic structure (onomasiological vs. semasiological dictionaries); and target audience (literate adults, language learners, language professionals). At the end of this course, students will have a fundamental understanding of the complexities of the dictionary genre as well as an appreciation of the role played by the medium in which the dictionary is compiled and consumed -- from clay tablets to computer screens.

**Learning outcomes**

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- appreciate the complexity of the dictionary genre and its history
- analyze the structure of a dictionary entry
- categorize dictionaries based on their content and/or target audience
- understand the role played by the medium in which the dictionary is compiled and consumed


## What is a dictionary?

Dictionaries lie at the core of humanity’s ability to conceptualize, systematize and convey meaning. But they are hardly positivistic, objective repositories of knowledge or truth about language, let alone the world in which we live. 

Indeed, a dictionary is many things at once: a text, a tool, a model of language, and a cultural artifact deeply embedded in the historical moment of its production. That means that dictionaries, like any other texts, will inevitably reflect the cultural, political and ideological values of their times, no matter when  and where they were written. 

"It's not in the dictionary, so it's not a word" is a sentence you may often hear in arguments about the "correctness" or "appropriatness" of certain words. But it's a shallow argument to make: not only because dictionaries can never achieve perfection, but because language itself is too varied and too complex to be captured in its entirety. No matter how hard you search, you will never find a dictionary that covers _all_ the words _and_ all the possible meanings of a given language.

So why do we make, use and study dictionaries? Why is it hard to digitize dictionaries if they were not already made with the help of computers? What's the future of dictionaries? Watch the following short video to get you started on these topics.

### The dictionary as a text

On its surface, it is relatively simple to describe what a *dictionary* is: indeed, most dictionaries define it either in terms of a physical object (a kind of book) or more abstractly as a source of information (a reference work) which contains *a list of words with some infromation about them*. As a kind of text, print dictionaries tend to be extremly dense, especially in the print domain, dictionaries are filled with abbreviations and symbols. They tend to be laid out in two columns, with narrow margins and using very little white space -- because printing on paper and distributing books across the globe was never cheap. Over time, lexicographers, i.e. dictionary makers, developed a number of strategies and conventions that that tipify this textual genre, for instance:

* space-saving devices such as *abreviations* or *symbols* such as the swung dashes (~) to avoid the repetition of words; 
* the practice of *cross-referencing*, or pointing users from one place in a dictionary to another to avoid duplicating similar or the same information in different parts of the dictionary
* a highly concise mode of expression
* typographic highlights such as the use of bold fontface for *lemmas* or *headwords*, to help users navigate the content and quickly find a answer of user needs, etc.

Relating lexicographic works to the print medium also makes  sense historically because the growth and development of the dictionary as a textual genre was very much a product of the print culture as it started emerging in Europe from the late 15th century onwards. 

The “typographic fixity” made possible by the printing presses (Eisenstein 1979: I, 116-120) fully transformed the European intellectual landscape: its methods of data collection, retrieval and storage, and its patterns of communication. In many ways, it was the substantial, durable and reproducible form of the book — its perceived stability and palpable reality as opposed to the ephemeral nature of speech — that made it possible for dictionaries to be perceived as authoritative reference works in the first place.
    
As texts, dictionaries are *secondary modeling systems*: they outline the contours of language and make meaning classifiable, definable and — ultimately — controllable. The notion of the dictionary as a book — *das Wörterbuch*, a wordbook — is not a terminological accident but rather a complex cultural concept that evolved over time. 

But the history of the idea of the dictionary — of what this peculiar textual genre is and what it represents — is far from over. That is why dictionary definitions of the word dictionary will have to remain provisional. This should not prevent us from asking broader questions about what the dictionary is — and, indeed — what it could become. What happens when a printed dictionary gets translated into an electronic dictionary? What is lost and what gained, if anything, in this process of translation? How does the transformation of dictionaries from discrete physical objects into networked hypertexts affect their cultural status?

#### Carved in stone? The role of the medium

Think of the way Thomas Blount defined _coffee_ (coffa) in his _Glossographia; or, a dictionary interpreting the hard words of whatsoever language, now used in our refined English tongue_, a very popular dictionary of its time, first published in 1656:

![](http://i.imgur.com/mIs4Ir9.png)

Was 17th century coffee more potent than the one we use today? Did it really rid people of debilitating depression and misanthropic cynicism? Why does Blount's definition feel and read differently than the ones provided by the modern lexicographic works such as _The Chambers Dictionary_ or _The New Oxford American Dictionary_ (NOAD)?

![](http://i.imgur.com/mvV1Z9k.jpg)
The Chambers Dictionary

![](http://i.imgur.com/NcnS4y1.png)
The New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD)

**Exercise.** Spend some time analyzing the above three entries. What would you say were the main stylistic features of lexicographic prose? How would you describe the tone of Blount's entry when compared to _The Chambers_ or the NOAD? What conclusions can you draw from the fact that modern entries for  _coffee_ contain more lexical information? And yet Blount's definition addresses something that other definitions don't: coffee as a stimulant. What do you make of that?

Historical, legacy dictionaries remain valuable to humanists precisely because they provide culturally shaded insights into the lexical knowledge of a particular epoch — sometimes in contrast to contemporary experiences, attitudes or values. We study legacy dictionaries not because we need them for linguistic survival in a world of fauxhawks, twerking and jeggings, but because they have something important to teach us about language, about the people who wrote them and about the time in which they were written.

When you analyzed the above three entries, you've probably also noticed that they don't only sound different, they also _look_ different.

In terms of typography and layout, there are important differences not only between 17th and 21st century dictionaries, but also between the two modern dictionaries. _The Chambers_, for instance, is more compact: it doesn't number separate senses, it uses abbreviations (*n* for *noun*, *Turk* for *Turkish*, *Ar* for *Arabic* etc.). The authors of the NOAD, on the other hand, don't seem to be fans of abbreviations; they use much more whitespace, start each example or subsense in a new line, and have a separate section for etymology ("Origin").

These differences can be partly ascribed to the fact that  _The Chambers_ is a print dictionary, and the entry from the NOAD comes from its  electronic edition. Print dictionaries are like prime real estate: space in them _is_ very expensive. As we already mentioned above, lexicographers have over time developed a set to conventions that they use to *structure*, *abbreviate* and *layout* dictionary content in the most compact way possible in order to limit the costs of printing and to make the end product manageable, easy to hold and browse through even for those of us who have not descended from giants. Some of those conventions, as we can see, are no longer strictly necessary when a dictionary is published electronically//digitally.

### The dictionary as a tool

While some of us lucky devils use dictionaries as *research objects*, studying their history and evolution over time, the majority of users see dictionaries as *tools*, i.e., devices that help them satisfy certain informational needs. Even though dictionaries are texts, most of us do not read them, certainly not from A to Z. Most of us *consult* dictionaries form time to time, by *looking up* particular words or expressions that we want to learn something about.

To every rule there is an exception. This also applies to *reading dictionaries*. Not only are some works of literature written in the form of a dictionary -- think of Milorad Pavić's celebrated postmodernist novel *The Dictionary of the Khazars* [^1] -- but think also of Ammon Shea's fun account of his monumental enterprise: reading 21,730 pages of the _Oxford English Dictionary_ in one year.

[^1]: One of the most celebrated postmodernist novels of the 20th century — Milorad Pavić’s *The Dictionary of the Khazars: A Novel Lexicon in 100,000 words*, published in 1984] — is written as a pseudo-dictionary. It is described as a
reconstruction of the lost Lexicon Corsi, supposedly compiled by a Pole, Joannes Daubmannus in 1691, but destroyed in 1692. It is a collection of fragmentary, alphabetized, cross-referenced entries about dreams, love, memory and knowledge set against the background of the religious conversion of the Khazar people in the eighth century.

Even if dictionaries are seen as inventories of language, in the origins they were lists of difficult words to teach writing. The students were required to make copies of these lists, thus training their handwriting and learning how to write new words by thematic groups. Then, during the Middle Age, the practice of glossing texts – explaining the meaning of difficult words through notes – also came to life. The glosses were written between the lines or in the margins of the texts, hence leading to the introduction of the designation interlinear gloss (written between one line and another), which later changed to marginal gloss (written in the margins). Medieval bilingual glossary listings (Latin-Vernacular) were published primarily to assist the learning of Latin throughout the period. to date back to John Bullokar’s An English Expositor (1616), included in the ‘hard words’ tradition (Landau, 2001, pp. 46–52). Bullokar – who was a physician – included terms from medicine, logic, philosophy, law, astronomy and heraldry.
 

### The dictionary as a model of language

The dictionary presupposes a specific idea of language as a unified, delimited system consisting of *discrete meaningful units* (words) which have *basic, fixed meanings* (Seargeant 2011). 

When the supposed editor of the _Oxford English Dictionary_ on an episode of the US sitcom _Sarah Silverman Program_ declares that a made-up slang word had been “included as a word *within* the English language” (emphasis ours), he not only asserts the role of the OED as an instrument of lexical legitimization, but also postulates that the English language is an entity with clearly delimited borders, a privileged *inside* and an excluded *outside*. 

In many cases, identifying that one word “belongs to” a certain language (*cat* is English in a way that *chien* is not) is relatively easy in comparison to answering the question about what English — or any other language — *is*, where it begins and where it ends. After all, a named language is not an empirical entity: it is an abstracted construct based on socio-linguistic patterns of use. Even though a dictionary of a named language is usually *a lexical record of a particular language variety aimed at a particular audience*, by virtue of metonymy, it is typically perceived as a symbolic representation of the imaginary “whole” language.

The very idea of the dictionary and its organizational structure (entries containing ordered, numbered senses) has been predicated upon the belief that meanings are fixed and well-defined regardless of the context in which they occur. There are studies — especially those based on analysing large collections of text known as corpora — which seem to suggest that the way dictionaries tend to disambiguate senses, resolve ambiguities and avoid redundancy is “at best superficial and at worst misleading” (Hanks 2008: 125) because they create a false picture of what happens when language is used in reality.

But we have to be very clear about this: no matter what theoretical positions we take about language, no matter how much academics like to complicate -- and sometimes overcomplicate -- their objects of study, *a good dictionary is a useful dictionary*: some people use dictionaries to translate foreign words or to expand our vocabulary in our own languages; to check the spelling or the grammatical properties of words, or as guides through scientific terms. Academic types will *study* dictionaries -- including old, long forgotten ones -- not because they need them for linguistic survival in the world of fauxhawks, twerking and jeggings, but because dictionaries have something important to teach us about language, about the people who wrote them and about the time in which they were written.

### The dictionary as a cultural artifact

Dictionaries have always been shaped and influenced by the social values of their time. The motors of those values include religion, literature, education, politics, economics and language planning (Hausmann 1989a; Mackintosh 2006). Cultural and ideological perspectives are reflected in the selection of words; the selection of geographic and social idiolects; the treatment of lexical variations; the value judgements implied in dictionary labels (what is considered *colloquial*?, what's *vulgar* and what's only *jocular*?), etc. That is why a dictionary is “a mirror of its time, a document to be understood in sociolinguistic terms” (Kahane and Kahane 1992: 20).

**Exercise.** Pick up your favorite dictionary and look up some simple words such as *man*, *woman* and *marriage*? Think about how these words are defined. Do they reflect the social reality around you? Do you recognize yourself in them? Can you think of reasons why defining _marriage_ as a "formally recognized union between a man and woman" may not be accurate in all contexts or in all languages and all societies?

Although impartiality is fundamental to a lexicographer, the truth is that when we look up a word in a dictionary, we may find particular ideological assumptions, judgments and prejudices reflecting the way society viewed certain topics at a given time. Homosexuality [‘homossexualismo’], for example, was once defined as a ‘inversão sexual’ [sexual inversion] (PE, 1956, p. 795), which is unthinkable today. The word ‘mulher’ [woman] (PE, 1956, p. 1018) was defined as ‘pessoa do sexo feminino pertencente à classe inferior’ [female person belonging to the lower class], also once synonymous with the ‘sexo fraco ou frágil’ [weak or fragile sex] (PE, 1956, p. 1369). In summary, this happens because, over time, most dictionaries tend to reflect the dominant culture established in a society by the group of individuals who direct the ruling ideas, values, and beliefs that become the dominant worldview of a given society.

It is important to keep in mind though that dictionaries are not simply or exclusively passive receptors of social influence: they are both culturally constructed and culture-constructing (Fishman 1995). This is why dictionaries play such a crucial role in all four stages of *language standardization* (*selection*, *codification*, *acceptance* and *elaboration of a standard* -- see Haugen 1966).

This type of double bind — the dictionary as both an echo and a shaper of its time — has important consequences for the dictionary as a research object and for our consideration of dictionaries in the digital environment. Treating lexicography as part of cultural heritage, frees “the history of dictionaries from too heavy a dependence on certain potentially arid kinds of narrative of the form ‘61 per cent of the entries in Y derive from entries in X’, and engages it with broader and more humane questions about lexicology, the history of linguistics, the history of learned culture, indeed the history of culture in general” (Considine 2008: 314).

## How dictionaries came to be

### Ancient world

The oldest dictionaries that we know of — those produced in the Middle East, Ancient China and Ancient Greece — were created to help their users understand language which was either foreign or archaic. The possibility of a dictionary was based on two mutually complementary ideas: 

1. that words which are assumed to be known to the user can be used to describe those that are not; and
2. that words to be explained need to be arranged somehow in order for the user to be able to locate them.
    
The tabular prototypes, distant ancestors of what we would call a dictionary, are lists of words in Sumerian, in cuneiform script, engraved on clay tablets found in the city of Uruk (situated on the eastern banks of a channel of the Euphrates River). These clay tablets were used to teach writing. The students were required to make copies of these lists, thus training their handwriting and learning how to write new words.

A Summerian-Akkadian bilingual glossary, compiled in the second millennium BCE and inscribed in cuneiform on twenty-four clay tablets containing around 9,700 entries, is the oldest surviving dictionary known to humanity. This simple word list, written in parallel columns, was organized thematically in groups starting with words describing legal and administrative matters, followed by those describing the material world (wooden objects, pottery, animals, parts of the body etc.)

In both Ancient China and Ancient Greece, dictionaries were explicitly related to rich literary traditions. By the time Homeric epics were written down, transmitted and consumed as works of literature, their language was already perceived as difficult.

The Ancient Greek glossographic tradition culminated in the works of Aristophanes of Byzantium (c.257- c. 180BC), the librarian at Alexandria, who wrote a series of titles such as _On words suspected of not having been said by the ancients, Of the names of ages_, and _On kinship terms_, although it is disputed whether these were self-standing works or parts of a comprehensive dictionary called _Λέχεις_ [Lexeis] (Slater 1976: 237, n 11); Apollonius Sophista and his synthesizing _Homeric Lexicon_ in the first century CE; and Hesychius of Alexandria, who, in the fifth or sixth century CE, compiled a lexicon of obscure poetic and dialectal words, phrases and short proverbs. Glossographic tradition was explicitly intertextual: it was very common for ancient lexicographers to cite previous authors and build upon each other’s work.

At the beginning of ancient Latin lexicography, in the 1st century BCE, we can find works such as _Liber glossematorum_ by Lucius Ateius Philologus or _De verborum significatu_ by Marcus Verrius Flaccus, the latter being the most significant lexicon of the language. Hellenistic and Roman cultures established a model of studies based on the analysis of the texts by certain classic authors who, due to their style and moral teaching, deserved to be part of a canon. Herein lie the origins of the use of illustrative quotations in dictionaries.

### The Mdidle Ages

The Latin spoken in the Middle Ages -- often referred to as Vulgar Latin -- already had many differences compared to Classical Latin, the language of instruction in universities, liturgy or law. Thus, the practice of *glossing texts* -- explaining the meaning of difficult words through notes -- came to life. The glosses were written between the lines or in the margins of the texts to be read. Hence we speak of *interlinear and marginal glosess*.

### Academic tradition

The academic tradition  of producing dictionaries of *living languages* spread throughout Europe in the 17th century. These large-scale, mutli-authored, long-term dictionary project were initiated and maintained by official national bodies, called acadmies, which were initially established to record and promote authoritative accounts of national languages.

The beginning of this movement can be traced to the project of the members of the Florentine society, _Accademia della Crusca_, when they published the _Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca_ in 1612. The _Vocabulario_ was followed by the _Dictionnaire de l’Académie Française_, which was started in the 1630s and published in 1694 in Paris. This institutional model was very successful and was followed by the Royal Society of London (1662), the Paris Académie Royale des Sciences (1666) and the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (1700), among others. 

At the dawn of the 18th century, several English dictionary projects that were inspired by the academic tradition emerged in different institutional contexts: "the bulk of lexicographic work[...] was [...] done by enterprising publishers and engaged individuals, such as Dr Samuel Johnson" (Klein, 2015).

Samuel Johnson’s  magnum opus, _A Dictionary of the English Language_ (Johnson, 1755)...

TODO: Toma to add a little more about Johnson

NEW: Johnson’s Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language (2017) sketches out the contours of a highly ambitious lexicographic project whose “chief intent” is “to preserve the purity and ascertain the meaning of our English idiom” (Lynch 2009, 177).
This is a striking turn of phrase for two reasons: (1) it positions the prescriptive quest for purity in language as if before the very act of semantic description; and (2) Johnson’s use of the personal determiner our in “our English idiom” signals the value he ascribes to language not as an abstract but rather as a very concrete social entity, a community of speakers that share a common identity. Despite his self-deprecating references to dictionary writing as “drudgery for the blind” and “artless industry” which consists of “beating the track of the alphabet” while requiring no personal quality other than “dull patience” and “sluggish resolution” (Ibid.), Johnson’s actual theoretical projection is based on the vision of lexicography as an art which is both meticulously methodical and monumentally moralistic.
Almost everything he says he wants to accomplish in and with his dictionary as a tool — an object whose value “must be estimated by its use” (Ibid.) — is also framed by the singular mission of pursuing the ideal of linguistic purity as a way of boosting national pride and the “the reputation of our tongue” (Ibid.: 188).


### Dictionaries and nation building

TODO: briefly, XIX century, examples America, Russia, Serbia, Czech...

### The corpus-linguistic turn

briefly: corpora and dictionary writing systems 

NEW: The production of dictionaries has been for several decades hardly
imaginable without the use of computer technology (Knowles 1989; Meijs 1992;
Hockey 2000). Easily searchable large corpora, the ability to study collocational features, and the advent of the Internet as a platform for the production and distribution of knowledge have undoubtedly altered lexicographic practice. At the same time, the use of computers has not changed one fundamental aspect of lexicographic enterprise: a perceptual disjuncture between what Seargeant (2011) calls “lexicographic ideology” — a widely held belief that a dictionary represents an accurate and complete account of a fixed entity called language — and the reality of lexicographic practice which can in fact result exclusively in partial and incomplete snapshots of language, which, as an institutional and a social construct, is always a moving target. With or without digital technology, an ideal dictionary is merely a chimaera: it can only ever be imagined. An ideal dictionary would be impossible to
produce — not only because language changes and new words are constantly being coined — but also because lexicographic knowledge, despite the appearance of authority, is, ultimately, based on interpretation.

## What makes a dictionary dictionary?

The main body of a dictionary has three structures: macrostructure, microstructure, and mediostructure. The terms macrostructure and microstructure are the most used within the lexicographic community.

The dictionary structure is the sum of all the parts of a dictionary. A semasiological-oriented dictionary is always organised into a relatively stable structure that interconnects its different parts.

FIGURE!!! Model of a Dictionary Structure (Salgado, 2021)


### Macrostructure
- emergence of the alphabetic order
the macrostructure (systematic arrangement of lexical items in the dictionary)

All the aspects related to the number of lexical items, the type of registered lexical units, and their arrangement in the dictionary are related to the macrostructural scope. Thus, in this work, we understand macrostructure as the set of the lexical units included in the dictionary making up the lemma list and their respective organisation (e.g., alphabetical order, arrangement of homographs, sublemma organisation).
### Microstructure
- understanding dictionary entries.
the microstructure (systematic arrangement of information within a lexical item in a dictionary)
The microstructure includes all the ordered lexical information present in each dictionary entry.we The term microstructure is used to refer to the multiple lexicographic components that constitute a lexicographic article. The type of information given varies depending on the type, purpose and size of the dictionary. Typically, dictionaries include the following information: grammatical information, such as part of speech, gender, number; usage labels; meaning; examples; etymology; and elements of representation (e.g., icons or symbols). In summary, the microstructure provides information on the form, meaning or semantic information, syntagmatic information on fixed combinations, and paradigmatic information involving synonyms, hyponyms, etc. The format of a lexicographic article is defined by certain typographic conventions, explanatory texts and symbols.

### Mediostructure
- hypertext
the mediostructure (a systematic network connecting various data points in the dictionary).
The mediostructure corresponds to the cross-referencing of different components of a dictionary, particularly between lexicographic articles. . While in print dictionaries, there are cross-references, in digital dictionaries, there are hyperlinks that point to a certain lexicographic article or a particular sense. The main difference is that, in print dictionaries, you were stuck to the object – there was no getting out of the book; and, in a digital environment, you can ‘get out of the box’ with the insertion of external links.
We have also mentioned cross-referencing as an example of a convention; this is associated with the notion of hypertextuality. A print dictionary is never a sequential type of text. For instance, when looking up a word in a dictionary, one will probably not read it linearly since many lexicographic articles are linked with others.

### Semantic structure: semasiology vs. onomasiology.
In a semasiological approach, one starts from the lexical unit to identify the meaning(s). In an onomasiological approach, we begin from the concept to identify the lexical unit designating it. Finally, in a mixed approach, as adopted in this thesis, lexical units are treated according to lexicographic and terminological assumptions that consider the double dimension (conceptual and linguistic) of terminology.


## Dictionary typologies
There is no standardised and consensual dictionary taxonomy, and there probably never will be. However, in the history of lexicography, it is possible to find some attempts to build organised schemes to classify existing dictionaries, where each author proposes their point of view.Among the various proposals, there are huge overlaps and, at times, some inconsistency. 
We restricted to those we consider the most relevant distinctive properties for lexicographic research and work. When compiling general dictionaries, we also took into account the following attributes:

### Source and target languages 

TODO: what about source and target languages - we use ISO definitions in TEI Lex-0

Depending on the number of languages described, dictionaries can be classified as monolingual, bilingual or multilingual. According to Svensén (1993), ‘The monolingual dictionary describes a language by means of that language itself: it gives the meanings of words by means of definitions or explanatory paraphrases’ (p. 20). Bilingual dictionaries routinely distinguish between the source and target languages. Svensén (1993) also stated that ‘The bilingual dictionary shows how words and expressions in one language (the source language) can be reproduced in another language (the target language). This is done by showing the expression in the source language, followed by one or more equivalents in the target language’ (pp. 20–21). Multilingual dictionaries, as we can infer from the name itself, include several languages; they are closely related to bilingual dictionaries, but the equivalent information for a lexical unit is given in several languages.

### Types of language(s) and topic(s) covered 

(general language, encyclopedic, terminological)

### Normativity 

prescriptive, descriptive
Normativity. Dictionaries can be descriptive or prescriptive/normative, establishing the model to follow. Prescriptivism is an approach that attempts to determine the rules of correct usage of a language, while descriptivism is an approach that analyses and describes how the speakers of a language actually use it.

### Target audience

Target audience (literate adults, language learners, language professionals).

### Medium

A dictionary can be compiled and used on different media:
– analogue, which refers to all non-digital documentation media, whose example par excellence is paper, i.e., printed dictionaries but also includes, for instance, Sumerian clay tablets;
– digital refers to those dictionaries currently available on the web or in mobile apps, but it can also denote a print dictionary since it is possible to envisage a scenario where we use a dictionary-writing software and still distribute the dictionary as a book. Additionally, in this category, we include all dictionaries in electronic media that are no longer commercialised (e.g., floppy disk, CD, DVD, pen drive). In this case, it is still important to distinguish born-digital dictionaries, created as machine-readable, from retrodigitised dictionaries, which were converted from an analogue (paper) or digital (e.g., PDF) medium to a computer-readable format, using optical character recognition systems and involving the encoding step of the scanned version. As such, a dictionary generated with a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, can be described as born-digital. Further included in this category are any resources compiled using a computer. Digital dictionaries and retrodigitised dictionaries are usually compiled into databases, giving rise to the so-called lexical resources.

### Format

Dictionaries are compiled, modelled and encoded in multiple diverse formats, indicating that the information is organised and stored in files of a different nature, hindering the path of sustainability and imposing constraints due to interoperability issues. The formats can thus refer to different types of files:
– general purpose formats, such as plain text, Microsoft Word (e.g., doc or docx, xls) or PDFs; and
– structured data formats, such as Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Lexical Markup Framework (LMF), Resource Description Framework (RDF).

### Temporal perspective

The time axis here is relevant. Dictionaries can be contemporary, i.e., they can be subject to constant updating, but we also intend to work with legacy dictionaries, i.e., dictionaries of great linguistic, historical and cultural interest. Both can be subdivided into diachronic (historical evolution of each word’s form and meaning) and synchronic (the language in a specific period of its evolution) dictionaries.
Method. The methodological approach adopted can be of a semasiological, onomasiological, or mixed nature. In a semasiological approach, one starts from the lexical unit to identify the meaning(s). In an onomasiological approach, we begin from the concept to identify the lexical unit designating it. Finally, in a mixed approach, as adopted in this thesis, lexical units are treated according to lexicographic and terminological assumptions that consider the double dimension (conceptual and linguistic) of terminology.
