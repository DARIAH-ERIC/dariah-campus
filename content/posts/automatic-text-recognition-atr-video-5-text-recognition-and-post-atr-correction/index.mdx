## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

- Build and train models to recognise and interpret text within images.
- Apply concepts of machine learning specific to ATR to improve recognition accuracy.
- Create ground truth data for training and validating ATR models.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different ATR models based on their output quality.

You can read the blogpost (available in English, French, and German), and watch our video (with subtitles in English, French, and German) embedded in the post.
