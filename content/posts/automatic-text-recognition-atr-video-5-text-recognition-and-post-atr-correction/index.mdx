## Learning Outcomes

- Build and train models to recognise and interpret text within images.
- Apply concepts of machine learning specific to ATR to improve recognition accuracy.
- Create ground truth data for training and validating ATR models.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different ATR models based on their output quality.
