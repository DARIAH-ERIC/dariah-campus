## Introduction

In this resource, our key concept is the prosopon. A prosopon is an invaluable tool in historical and literary studies, representing a collected literary depiction of a person. A prosopon is a collected literary representation of a person. This means that it includes all forms of information about an individual, gathered from various sources such as texts, records, and artifacts. In some ways, it’s true that all we can ever get to about past people is their construction in source, whether through other people’s (and in a few cases their own) literary representations of them, or record documents, or artifacts. By studying prosopons, we can piece together comprehensive portraits of individuals from the past, even if these portraits are sometimes fragmented or biased by the perspectives of their creators. Prosopons help us understand the societal roles, personal relationships, and historical significance of individuals, giving us a richer context of the past.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this training resource, learners should be able to: 

- Understand the fundamentals of prosopography, a method used to investigate the common characteristics of historical individuals through collective study.
- Understand the basics of the practice of prosopography
- Define a prosopon within the context of prosopography and its practice
- Know how to handle main issues with prosopography including: multiple people with the same name, anonymous entries and fictional people. This includes developing strategies for distinguishing between individuals and dealing with ambiguous or conflicting information. Learners will also be equipped to use databases effectively for prosopographical research, ensuring accurate and efficient data management.

### Terminology

The term prosopon is therefore important for distinguishing our collection of what people said and thought about a person – the image of that person we are able to construct today – from the person themselves, who this may or may not be an accurate depiction of. Prosopons allow us to separate the subjective interpretations and portrayals of individuals from their actual historical existence, which may remain partially or wholly unknown. This distinction is crucial in maintaining the objectivity and reliability of historical research.

##### _What is the difference between person-prosopon and factoid?_

In a person-prosopon database, a prosopon is meant to represent an actual, real, living person: they’re treated as being the same thing, and it’s the job of the database’s author to get them as close as possible, resolving any contradictions in the source material. This method strives for historical accuracy and coherence, ensuring that the information aligns with known facts and reliable sources. The goal is to create a detailed and accurate representation of an individual’s life and context.

In a factoid database, this isn’t the case, and the prosopon can be internally contradictory: it’s just a collection of things people said about this constructed person. Factoid databases accept and reflect the inherent uncertainties and contradictions in historical records, presenting a multifaceted view of the individual. This approach acknowledges that historical records often contain conflicting information, and aims to preserve the diversity of perspectives and sources.

#### Disambiguation: the Rusudan Problem

There are many names for this problem within the practice of prosopography: it’s always named after whichever name the academic has the most common problems disambiguating. In many cases for historians of medieval Georgia, that’s references to “Rusudan”, the most popular women's name among the 12th century Georgian ruling family. This means that there can often be two or three Rusudans at court at the same time, without many clear ways to tell them apart. Such ambiguities are not unique to medieval Georgia and can be found in many historical contexts, requiring careful analysis and cross-referencing of available data. This is a problem in all eras of prosopography: even in the nineteenth century when the widespread use of surnames (not always a given) makes people more identifiable. For example, common names in any era can lead to similar confusion, necessitating detailed contextual analysis to distinguish between individuals.

For example, a private letter from a letter collection won’t necessarily identify which acquaintance of a particular given name is being mentioned e.g. “We went to William’s for dinner” when the person might well know at two or three Williams as close acquaintances given it’s common status as a name.

##### _How do you disambiguate – and when do you do so?_

A lot of disambiguation work is based on context and happens on a case by case basis. There is no perfect rule and no right answer. One result of this is that some databases try to avoid disambiguation as much as possible. In these cases, if someone cannot be fairly definitively identified as being a specific person, they get a separate record entry. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the data, avoiding incorrect assumptions and potential misidentifications.

One can link record entries together, by having a table or edge type called “IsSameAs” or “ProbablySameAs”, to store those links. This can be important when you want the option to suggest that two people might be the same, without absolute certainty. Such links provide a flexible framework for users to explore possible connections and interpretations.

Key advice would be to avoid probabilistic disambiguation: that is, resist the urge to try to attach numbers like “I think there’s a 25% chance that this person is this person.” Such numerical indicators can give both you and future users a false sense of scientism and accuracy.

Where you do disambiguate, always ensure that there is some storage of your reasoning for doing so. Not only future users, but also you in a year or two’s time, might well want to know on what basis you made a decision of this kind. Documenting your reasoning ensures transparency and allows for future reassessment or verification of the decisions made.

Sometimes disambiguation is impossible – you have two (or more) options of equal probability. This is where having a system for probable similarity can help, as you can make multiple of those connections. Or you can pick one, and just note that the other is possible. This flexibility is crucial in maintaining the usability and reliability of the database. It allows future researchers to understand the nuances and complexities involved in your decision-making process.

### Anonymi

One of the biggest problems is how to deal with anonymous individuals (anonymi – it’s a Latin plural). Imagine you find an inscription saying “The Emperor was murdered here.” How many people are mentioned here? This question highlights the challenges of interpreting historical records where key details are missing or ambiguous.

At the fewest, zero – there’s nobody definitively named, and you might not be sure which Emperor is mentioned, so it would be methodologically valid to scrap this as evidence altogether. Most methodologies would probably input to one person record from this – the Emperor is clearly discussed, and even if you’re not sure now which Emperor it was, the surrounding information is enough that someone in the future might make the link. However, it's essential to consider the potential for multiple interpretations and the context in which the information was recorded.

You can have even more people though. By definition, murder requires a murderer, otherwise it’s just a death, so there’s an implied anonymous murderer involved. It would be valid to put in a record for that person, in case you can track down details about them from identifying the event later. This approach ensures that all relevant actors are accounted for, even if they are not explicitly named.

And that’s not all – Emperors rarely come from nowhere, so you might well be able to assume some details about the Emperor’s parents. Everyone in history thus far has at least two biological parents, after all. So you could generate four people from this simple sentence. This highlights the complexity and interconnectedness of historical records, where even a single statement can imply multiple individuals.

We’ve seen several sorts of anonymi here that you may or may not want to account for:

- People with very specific job or noble titles without names. If the title is rare enough, these may be some of the easier people to identify.
- People mentioned with some other key individualising feature e.g. “Sir William’s Wife”. This is quite a specific identifier.
- People discussed in detail without title (so for example “and then a man with red hair and a lion on his shield rode out at the head of the army” or “and then the cunning herald of the Emperor came to see the rebels”. These are hypothetically identifiable people, but the probabilities will be more or less good depending on the depth of source material available. The identification of such individuals often requires a deep dive into contextual evidence and may remain speculative.

## Potentially Fictional People

##### _How do you handle people who may be literary devices?_

How do you handle people who may be literary devices? This is a challenging aspect of prosopography, as distinguishing between historical fact and literary fiction can be difficult.

This is more difficult. For example, a chronicler might create a vignette where an unnamed peasant talks to the Emperor about the hardships of the common people. It’s possible that such an event existed, but it’s also possible that the words are given to the peasant as a literary device. Understanding the intent and context of the source material is crucial in such cases.

Parents. You’ll often know more about the parents of someone, even if they’re never explicitly mentioned, than you do about, especially in cultures where a lot of aspects of status are heritable. However, of course extrapolating ancestors could be a potentially infinite process – my instinct is to generally not do this unless you have good methodological cause. Carefully considering the implications of including hypothetical or inferred individuals can help maintain the accuracy and relevance oftheir accuracy and relevance. One good reason to do it, as an example, is if you want to simplify family relationships to being parent-child only, which may make processing them easier. In this case, if you had a sibling relationship in the text but the parents were unmentioned, you’d need to include them to represent the sibling relationship properly.

Implied actors, such as the murderer in the above example, who are only identified by the fact that someone must have done the action. In general I suspect most methodologies will exclude these, but you might have a good reason for including them – for example in trade studies, if you have information that some goods went from point A to point B then the implied merchants who must have carried them may well be of prosopographical interest to you.



You don’t have to include anonymi at all – that’s a valid methodological choice – but it’s likely you’ll want to include some of them, and you should develop a clear idea of which ones you want to include, based on a) the chance of identifying them later and b) which ones are likely to be appropriate for the kinds of questions you want to answer. 

#### Fictional persons: or, the Alexander the Great Problem 

A prosopon isn’t necessarily a “real” person. This seems like it shouldn’t be much of an issue – surely people are either real or not real? Unfortunately, there isn’t actually any clear boundary between a “real” person and a “fictional” one in much of our source material. This may seem counter-intuitive – after all, someone either existed or they didn’t – but let’s consider Alexander the Great as an example. 

We’re pretty sure Alexander existed, and he’s probably one of the people most mentioned in ancient and medieval historical sources from a huge range of countries. But stories about Alexander in historical materials cover a complete range of plausibility: we’re all fairly confident that Alexander was king of Macedon, and was at battles like Gaugamela, but how confident should we be of the stories about him visiting oracles, or the various tales (which conflict) about him solving the Gordian Knot? 

What about Alexander as he appears in the founding myths of other countries, where he’s used as a legitimising device? Or in some medieval texts, which basically go all the way up to full￾fledged fantasy romances? To what extent are these meaningfully the same Alexander? And where should we draw the “plausibility line”? 

This poses problems for all types of database. In a factoid database, the problem is where your definition of the person ends: if your collection of sources includes some obviously fantastical and some plausible information about the same person, do you treat that as being one person or two? Because of the factoid model’s agnosticism about whether information has any truth values, there can therefore be a cluttering problem for some individuals as information at very differing plausibility levels is mixed. In a person-prosopon model, your issue meanwhile is to actually decide what you think is true and where the boundary lies, and therefore what should be included. This is likely to be a case by case process.

## Conclusion

By now you understand the key concept of the prosopon. You should know that a prosopon is a collected literary representation of a person and how to use terminology surrounding the nuance of prosopons, as well as issues surrounding anonymi and fictional peoples. Mastering these concepts allows you to effectively navigate the complexities of historical and literary records, ensuring a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the past.
