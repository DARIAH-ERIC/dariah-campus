This module looks at some of the key management issues that arise within research infrastructures with a clarity and urgency they donâ€™t often have below the infrastructural scale. It also looks at key trends and developments in these areas, and how exemplar projects are applying them. In particular, this module covers: User Engagement, Communications and Audiences, Sustainability, and the Macro-level issues, including managing the political environment.
