abstract: In this lecture, Teresa Scassa examines the complex role of
  intellectual property(IP) rights in the creation and advancement of academic
  knowledge. While IP rights can create barriers to access, reuse and
  transparency, she argues, they can also further creativity and innovation by
  providing revenue, and by protecting other values such as
  privacy/confidentiality, and integrity/authenticity. IP rights can also, in
  some circumstances, protect against the exploitation of individuals and
  communities. Framing IP rights in terms of a sometimes complex web of
  relationships, this presentation asks what role IP rights should play in
  ethically open science.
