Dr. Mark Hall from Open University UK gives an introduction to Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) and how they can be used in (digital) Humanities projects.  

APIs feature in all the programs and apps we use, but from a research perspective, particularly in the digital humanities and cultural heritage, APIs offer a way to gather large amounts of data from collections for further analysis.  Many Cultural Heritage institutions also offer APIs to help access their collections.  But APIs can seem daunting to someone who hasn't used them before.  In this webinar, Mark Hall explains what an API is, and how they can be called on to complete queries on metadata.

This webinar was recorded as part of the DARIAH Friday Frontiers webinar series.
