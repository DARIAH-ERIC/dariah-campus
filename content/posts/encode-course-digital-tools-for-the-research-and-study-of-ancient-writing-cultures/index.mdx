The ENCODE open online course 'Digital tools for the research and study of ancient writing cultures' is designed to introduce teaching staff, GLAM professionals, and graduates to ancient writing cultures and digital studies. It consists of four units: Digital Greek-Latin Epigraphy, Digital Papyrology, Multilingual-Multicultural Digital Infrastructures, and How to Create LOD (linked open data). 

In this course, you will explore the digital transformations in the fields of Greek and Latin epigraphy, papyrology, and other aspects of ancient writing cultures. It offers several excercises to test your competences and knowledge, for instance on producing and sharing digital editions, managing FAIR data, and structuring and contextualizing information. You will also learn how to disseminate open knowledge related to ancient written cultural heritage. By the end of the course, you should be able (with the support of experts) to design a syllabus that effectively delivers digital competencies to trainees in the study of ancient writing cultures.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this course, learners will be able to:

- understand the digital transformations in the field of ancient writing cultures
- practise some essential activities to participate in digital infrastructures and the sharing of research data
- identify and choose the teaching and learning resources that can help to upskill digital competences related to ancient written objects
- manage tools to integrate digital competences in the teaching and learning of ancient writing cultures
