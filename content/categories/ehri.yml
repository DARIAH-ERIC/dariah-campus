name: EHRI
description: Transnational Holocaust research, commemoration and education is
  the mission of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI), and its
  main challenge is the wide dispersal of sources and expertise across many
  institutions.  EHRI overcomes such fragmentation by connecting sources,
  institutions and people from a wide range of disciplines across the Humanities
  and Social Sciences.  EHRI has been funded by the EU and aims to become a permanent organisation in the form of a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) by January 2025
