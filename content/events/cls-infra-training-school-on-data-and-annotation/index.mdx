  This event, organised and provided by the CLS INFRA project, offers an introductory course to textual data annotation.  The workshop introduces learners to how to edit, annotate, and query a text corpus without a single line of code, how to structure texts with the XML-TEI, and how to run an NLP tool to add linguistic information.

  **What do I bring to prepare for the training?**


  Corpus building is an integral part of this workshop. Therefore, you should have to hand a few text files of your own interest, for your individual hands-on experience with building a corpus. These files do not necessarily have to be in English.


  **Who is this course for?**


  This is an elementary course for actual beginners. If you have any NLP/programming skills, if you have ever built your own corpus or queried one beyond looking for a single word, or if you are well-versed in XML-TEI, this course would be too slow for you.


  If you do have prior experience with the skills offered in this training school, you might still have fun scrolling through the teaching materials or apply for a fellowship to pursue your individual research or teaching project with the on-site support by our [CLS INFRA project partners](https://clsinfra.io/opportunities/tnafellowships/).

      We use the Shakespeare Drama Corpus to show you how to extract information with corpus-linguistic methods - which questions you can ask and what answers you can expect. This is a general overview; you will learn details of the individual tools and methods in the following sessions.

      This session introduces the basic principles of the XML markup and presents the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI-XML) guidelines as an encoding standard for digital editions and textual corpora. The students produce a valid TEI-XML document and upload it to TEITOK, our web-based platform for viewing, creating, and editing corpora with both rich textual mark-up and linguistic annotation.

  - title: Universal Dependencies – Morphology

      - cinková-silvie
    body: >-
      This session presents UDPipe, an NLP tool to analyse texts in more than seventy languages. UDPipe works with Universal Dependencies. Universal Dependencies is a framework for consistent grammar annotation across human languages. We particularly focus on its morphological annotation scheme, explaining the individual part-of-speech labels, as well as the more fine-grained morphological features, on English. A separate session deals with the syntactic markup.

      CQL (Corpus Query Language, developed in the 1990s) is the de facto standard in the field, used by the most current corpus query tools. We start with explaining the students the regular expressions and gradually and diverse restrictions within a single token query. We demonstrate the searches in Kontext, the corpus manager developed and maintained by the Institute of the Czech National Corpus.

    body: >-
      This session explains the TEI-XML header structure, its relation to the document body, good practice and its implementation in TEITOK. It prepares the students for setting up their own corpus of philological texts with complex headers and genre-specific text metadata. The students receive guidance to create their own document headers.

    body: >-
      This session is a continuation of the Base CQL session. It draws on queries about individual tokens and proceeds to queries on a sequence of tokens, introducing the concept of group referencing and metadata scope (e. g. within a single sentence). It also introduces aggregation and filtering functionalities of Kontext, the corpus manager used in the demonstration.

    speakers:
      - cvrček-václav
    body: >-
      This session explains statistical considerations on frequency in corpus linguistics, mainly the statistical significance and effect size of a difference between two frequency counts. Besides, it introduces several quantitative stylistics metrics, such as different flavors of lexical richness, descriptivity vs. narrativity, thematic concentration, and thematic weights of individual words. Students learn about the on-line tools Calc and QuitaUp to calculate these metrics automatically.

  - title: Universal Dependencies – Syntax
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
    body: >-
      This is a continuation of the Universal Dependencies – Morphology session. It explains the principles of dependency grammar and its UD flavor, touching upon the interplay between the linguistic form and function, as well as ambiguity and vagueness in the linguistic annotation. We explain the principles of dependency grammar and elaborate on the most common syntactic labels and their typical usage.

      - janssen-maarten
    body: >-
      In this session, students gain the basic overview of the state of the art in the Named-Entity Recognition and Entity Linking (referring from a linguistic entity to an external knowledge base). They learn about the main Entity Linking authorities, such as WikiData and VIAAF. They get a hands-on experience with TEITOK’s manual entity annotation module. Eventually, they get acquainted with TEITOK’s bulk editing module.

  - title: Tree queries - Grew
    speakers:
      - cinková-silvie
    body: >-
      This session teaches the students the foundations of Grew, a declarative tree query language, working with its implementation in TEITOK. We demonstrate the power of tree querying on searching the syntactically parsed Shakespeare corpus for salient semantic participants of a verb, which grammatical constructions to look for and how to implement the search in Grew.
