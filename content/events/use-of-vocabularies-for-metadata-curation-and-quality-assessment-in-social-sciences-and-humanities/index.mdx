  The event "Use of vocabularies for metadata curation and quality assessment in
  social sciences and humanities" was organised as part of the Horizon 2020
  funded project TRIPLE (Grant Agreement No. 863420.).
  https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/863420 The starting point for the
  organisation of this event was to analyse the challenges faced to create the
  multilingual GoTRIPLE vocabulary and compare it with other initiatives
  recently undertaken in the Social Sciences and Humanities branch of the
  European Science Cloud (EOSC) context.

    title: SSH Vocabulary Commons
    body: >-
      The SSH Vocabulary Commons  brings together experts and managers from SSH
      research infrastructures CESSDA, CLARIN, DARIAH and E-RIHS that agree to
      share their expertise and work towards common recommendations for firstly,
      using and managing vocabularies used in SSH and secondly operating,
      sharing and managing of vocabulary services useful for the broad SSH
      community.


      The SSH Vocabulary Commons work is specifically directed  towards:


      \- Common recommendations for creating, managing and using vocabularies used in SSH research and resource management that will make the SSH infrastructures better interoperable and more efficient.


      \- Aligning current vocabulary management practices with EOSC and FAIR principles making vocabularies first-class citizens, easy to find, share and access.


      \- Improving facilities for multilingual vocabularies.


      \- Promoting sharing of vocabularies and management procedures and software between different SSH domains and organizations  by recommending specific Knowledge Organization/Representation language formats e.g. SKOS and how to apply these e.g. vocabulary metadata, versioning 


      \- Providing easier cross domain integration of (meta)data and semantic interoperability by supporting and providing procedures for vocabulary matching


      \- Maintaining contacts with vocabulary software development teams and promote SSH infrastructure  interests


      \- Facilitating vocabulary recommendation, supporting researchers finding relevant vocabulary for their research.


      \- Providing a default vocabulary hosting and publishing service for orphaned vocabularies

  - body: The SSHOC Multilingual Terminologies consist of a set of multilingual
      metadata concepts and an automatically extracted multilingual Data
      Stewardship terminology. They have been created in the context of the
      SSHOC project as case studies, during an activity of investigation on how
      Language Technologies can help in promoting and facilitating
      multilingualism in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  The SSHOC
      Multilingual terminologies has been created to evaluate performances of
      state-of-the-art tools and to derive a set of recommendations as to how
      best apply them. The talk will present the main recommendations derived
      from the investigation and the workflow and tools adopted to publish the
      Terminologies as SKOS resources.

  - title: How to use vocabularies to enrich GoTriple ?
    speakers:
      - homo-julien
    body: The GoTriple platform is a discovery service for SSH publications. During
      the ingestion pipeline, it transforms metadata records into the Triple
      Data Model, it performs a series of cleansing, normalization and
      enrichment procedures - in order to deal with metadata heterogeneity,
      increase multilingualism and improve content searchability and
      discoverability - and, finally, it stores and indexes the enriched
      metadata records, making them searchable via the GoTriple search engine.
      During this process, many vocabularies are involved having a strategic
      role in the quality of the results and by extension in the satisfaction of
      the end users of the platform. What are these vocabularies? Where are they
      used and how? What are the difficulties encountered in the framework of
      GoTriple? We will try to answer these questions during the session.

    title: Using controlled vocabularies to organise keywords in the SSH
    body: Controlled vocabularies prove useful for improving the quality of topical
      keywords describing SSH publications. This presentation deals with the
      challenge of improving the quality of keywords which are expressed in the
      form of strings (keywords-strings). Experiences from Dariah.lab project
      (lab.dariah.pl) and TRIPLE project show that these keywords-strings on
      many occasions originate from controlled vocabularies if they were applied
      by institutional actors (e.g. data officers in digital libraries) and
      hence can be easily enriched with references to controlled vocabularies.
      On the other hand, keywords-strings from authors are less frequently
      originating from these kinds of resources. This presentation outlines
      automated and semi-automated methods for enriching both types of
      keywords-strings with references to controlled vocabularies.

  - title: Multilinguality and the use of vocabularies at Europeana
    speakers:
      - isaac-antoine
    body: Europeana gathers millions of metadata records from over 3500 libraries,
      archives and museums across Europe. Such a diversity with many quality
      issues (sparseness, heterogeneity, multilinguality). We present how
      Europeana and its partners work to address these issues, in a
      collaborative and flexible fashion. The Europeana Data Model paves the way
      for gathering richer metadata, but all parties need to exploit this
      potential. Especially, populating the data model's elements with
      multilingual linked open data vocabularies can bring a lot of value. We
      encourage our partners to publish richer metadata that exploits the
      controlled vocabularies they often already use. We also perform automatic
      metadata enrichment, using a purpose-built linked-data based "entity
      collection" as target. Finally, partners have also embarked on producing
      their own automatic metadata enrichments. In parallel, the Europeana
      network has developed a tier system for the Europeana Publishing
      Framework, which enables measuring and reporting on important aspects of
      metadata quality in the Europeana datasets.

  - title: ARIADNEplus vocabulary mapping strategy
    speakers:
      - binding-ceri
    body: The ARIADNEplus project aggregated over 3.5 million metadata records
      describing archaeological sites. These records were converted and
      integrated to an RDF triple store using a data schema based on the CIDOC
      Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), then exported to an OpenSearch index for
      use with the search portal UI. Search is via 3 major facets - place, time
      and subject. This presentation primarily concerns the subject integration
      work which involved 59 local vocabularies containing over 19,000 subject
      terms in 16 different languages. A vocabulary matching tool allowed each
      data provider to define correctly formatted mappings from their own local
      vocabularies to a central common 'spine' vocabulary (Getty Art &
      Architecture Thesaurus, AAT). Using the resultant mappings, the metadata
      records were enriched with AAT identifiers. The AAT poly-hierarchical
      structure was incorporated into the search system, facilitating both
      multilingual cross search and hierarchical subject expansion. This
      approach led to a noticeable improvement in both recall and precision.

  - title: Vocabularies in the SSH Open Marketplace
    speakers:
      - illmayer-klaus
    body: SSH Open Marketplace
      ([https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu))
      acts as a place to get information on tools, services, training materials,
      publications, datasets, and workflows from the Social Sciences and
      Humanities domain. Users can propose to add new items or to extend the
      information about existing items. SSH Open Marketplace data model operates
      with dynamic fields that can be connected to vocabularies. The
      presentation gives information about the technical background of the
      integration of vocabularies and shares experiences with this approach. On
      the “SSH vocabs commons” project the used vocabularies of the SSH Open
      Marketplace are represented. Ideas on how to further develop the “SSH
      vocabs commons” project are discussed from the perspective of the SSH Open
      Marketplace.

    title: Vocabularies in the OpenAire Graph
    body: The OpenAIRE Graph is an open collection of metadata about entities of the
      research life cycle (publication, research data, software, other types of
      research results, project grants, organisations, data sources)
      semantically linked with each other. Metadata and links are collected from
      trusted scholarly communication sources (like institutional repositories,
      data archives, publishers’ platforms, Crossref, DOAJ) and enriched thanks
      to data mining algorithms that detect duplicates, semantic relationships
      and subject classification. The talk will present how controlled
      vocabularies are used in the OpenAIRE Graph, focusing on those used for
      subject classification and how they are leveraged by the OpenAIRE services
      CONNECT, EXPLORE and MONITOR.

  - title: Vocabularies and quality improvement of library catalogues
    speakers:
      - király-péter
    body: "QA catalogue is a metadata quality assessment tool developed for MARC21
      and PICA metadata schema based library catalogues. Catalogues use
      vocabularies internally for recording their own structure and the terms
      particular data elements might contain, and externally for enhancing the
      descriptive data elements. This latter category covers two main areas:
      subject indexing and normalisation of (personal, family, corporate,
      geographical) names, titles and events. The tool reads MARC or PICA files
      (in different formats), analyses some quality dimensions, and saves the
      results into CSV files."

  - title: Comparing SSH vocabularies and their applications in different systems
    speakers:
      - rastinger-nina-c
      - carloni-massimiliano
      - ďurčo-matej
    body: >-
      Vocabularies are used in a wide range of services. These include long-term
      digital archives as well as research project overview websites and
      training platforms. Vocabularies allow depositors and users to describe
      resources by indicating their most relevant aspects, usually summarised in
      single keywords. Analysing vocabularies is therefore a productive way of
      discovering which aspects of a research area are covered by a particular
      service, and how services relate to each other. This hands-on session
      presents a practical workflow for comparing vocabularies from different
      services and identifying possible overlaps. “Vocabularies” is used here in
      a broad sense, including both controlled vocabularies (ranging from
      controlled lists to thesauri) and folksonomies, i.e. collections of
      uncontrolled keywords used in a service. A Jupyter notebook is included,
      containing the Python code needed to perform the comparison. A set of
      vocabularies are already provided for comparison (such as the SSH Open
      Marketplace keywords and Getty AAT). In addition, an accompanying
      presentation illustrates some preliminary thoughts on vocabulary
      terminology, usage and interoperability (with a special focus on the
      users’ perspective) as well as the description of a comparison between
      vocabularies of the Austrian DH community recently performed at the
      Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage.
