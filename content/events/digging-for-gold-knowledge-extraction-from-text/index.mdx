  ## Session 1 Python
  To get the most out of this session you will need to have a few things downloaded to your machine.

  **Anaconda**
  Installing: Local installation of Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook)
  [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) (download)


  **Google Collaborate**
  You will use Google Collaborate to access files on your browser
  [https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?hl=en](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?hl=en)

  You will download files from this GitHub repository:
  [https://github.com/sros-UNED/NLPforHumanist](https://github.com/sros-UNED/NLPforHumanist) download them through this link (code —> download zip)



  ## Session 5-8 Preparation Notes

  The most important technical requirement for Day 2 would be [installing
  R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and (preferably)
  [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (development environment for R that will
  make things easier). We will use the `stylo` library for most of the day; see [step-by-step
  introduction](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/#) to `stylo` for beginners,
  or the more extensive [HOW
  TO](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo_howto/blob/master/stylo_howto.pdf).

  In case you don’t / can’t install R and `stylo` locally, there will be an option to run analysis
  from Colaboratory notebooks, just be aware it will require _more_ coding, not less coding, because
  of the `stylo`’s interface that doesn’t work in Colab.  You are free to bring your own collection of
  texts to the workshop, but you can find more ready to use plain text fiction collections in
  various languages on the [Computational Stylistics
  website](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/).

  - title: "Digging for Gold IV: Word Embeddings"
    speakers:
      - ros-salvador
    body: >-
      In this lesson, students will use the natural language processing library, spaCy, to extract all the "scary" verbs from a corpus of horror books. They will then use the similarity function in spaCy to determine which verbs are most closely related to the concept of fear. Additionally, they will determine which book is the "scariest" by calculating the ratio of scary verbs to total words in each book. This exercise will provide students with an understanding of how natural language processing can be used to analyse and compare different works of literature based on a specific set of criteria.

  - title: "Digging for Gold V: Vector Semantics and Embeddings"
    speakers:
      - de-la-rosa-javier
    body: >-
      Embedding spaces and computational literary studies have emerged as a fruitful convergence of computer science and literary analysis. This presentation introduces the concept of embedding spaces, which represent textual data as high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic relationships and contextual information. Specifically, word embeddings enable tasks such as sentiment analysis and authorship attribution, while sentence and document embeddings facilitate analysis at larger text units. By leveraging computational methods, researchers can delve into the complexities of literature, offering quantitative insights and novel research avenues. This interdisciplinary approach holds great promise for revolutionising the study of literature and deepening our understanding of its intricacies.

      - šeļa-artjoms
      - byszuk-joanna
    body: >-
      This is an introductory overview of the field of stylometry and multivariate text analysis. We discuss classic approaches to text representation, such as bag of words, and show the ability of word frequencies to reflect meaningful cultural and social conditions of texts: genre, chronology and authorship.

      ## R and RStudio

      The most important thing to do would be installing R and RStudio on your machine. We will use the stylo library for most of the day; if you want, you can look at step-by-step introduction to stylo for beginners, or at the more extensive HOW TO, but we will cover all the basics.

      NB. In case you don’t / can’t install R and stylo locally, there will be an option to run analysis from Colab, just be aware it will require more coding, not less coding, because of the stylo’s interface that doesn’t work in Colab.

      You are free to bring your own collection of texts to the workshop, but you also can find plain text fiction collections in various languages on the Computational Stylistics website.

    speakers:
      - fradejas-rueda-josé-manuel
    body: >-
      In this session, we will try to find out whether the Old Spanish version of the Book of Alexander  was written by an author known as Gonzalo de Berceo, as it is stated in one manuscript, or not. We will gather the data from the Old Spanish Textual Archive (OSTA), a corpus of Old Spanish Texts lemmatised and PoS tagged. Then we will use the stylo package to find it out. Afterwards, we will try to see if the rhyming words are a good element to establish the authorship of the Book of Alexander.

  - title: "Showing Gold I: Visualisation"
    speakers:
      - benito-santos-alejandro
    body: >-
      This session aims to introduce visualisation grammars and their applications to accelerate exploratory data analysis in digital humanities projects by allowing users to create interactive visualisations with minimal effort in a Jupyter notebook. To this end, a real application will be built by replicating the design process of a visualisation system based on machine-annotated textual data, in a similar setup to many digital humanities research projects.

      Corpus data should be kept FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. This lecture will show how to do that using an example set-up in which the LINDAT repository is used for findability (as well as long-term preservation), TEITOK for accessibility (as well as maintenance and annotation), and TEI for interoperability and reusability. And we will show how to interact with these tools and standard both via a GUI (online) and using an API (to interact programmatically).
