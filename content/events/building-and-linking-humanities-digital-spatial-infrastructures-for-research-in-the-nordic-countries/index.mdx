  This workshop, focussing on "Spatial data medieval to modern", is the first of a series
  of workshops from the NOS-HS project "Linking, Building, and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial
  Infrastructures for Research in the Nordic Countries".  The main aims of this workshop were to
  define key concepts (spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data, metadata, ontology), outline major
  challenges in the field, and to provide an opportunity to share experiences of addressing the
  issues in individual and national projects across the Nordic countries.

about: >-
  The project **"Linking, Building and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial
  Infrastructures for Research in the Nordic Countries"** aims to bring together
  humanities researchers and research engineers and others in related sectors
  (museums, archives, libraries) who are working on geocoded humanities data
  pertaining to the Nordic countries and beyond. The objectives are to :


    (1)  generate dialogue and exchange between relevant academic and non-academic
  sectors on the subject of spatial data and data infrastructures in the
  Humanities, and


    (2) facilitate a collaborative initiative whereby common principles regarding ontologies and metadata will be mapped out by members of
  the network.


  Collaborative data infrastructure solutions based on Linked Open
  Data (LOD) and FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
  Reusable) will underpin and further advance Humanities research that
  builds on geocoded data.

  The project is a new Nordic co-operation creating a network with a shared vision regarding geocoded humanities data and sustainability needs.  In addition, the project positions Nordic participants and spatial data at the heart of a working group that aims to submit a European grant application under the Research Infrastructures call in the Horizon Europe Program for 2021-2027. Concrete results from the collaboration will be published in the form of reports and scientific papers.

  In this first workshop, three issues were addressed:

    (1) establishing common metadata
  principles and ontologies in Nordic Humanities digital spatial infrastructure
  for research;

    (2) implementation of Linked Open Data principles to existing
  datasets curated by workshop organizers;

    (3) work towards an EU grant application.

  Keynote speakers and invited participants shared theoretical and practical experiences.

    title: "Linked Open Cultural Heritage Data: LOD and RDF in Theory and Practice"
    body: >-
      The talk addresses implementation of Linked Open Data in the Swedish
      cultural heritage sector with SOCH (Swedish Open Cultural Heritage) as its
      main example. Challenges of updating bespoke legacy solutions in order to
      achieve greater compatibility with overarching aggregators such as
      Europeana are also illuminated.

    body: >-
      Leif Isaksen talks the listener through the issues of making SDIs out of
      often messy humanities data. Special attention is paid to data management,
      i.e. reliability, bias vs. flexibility, scope, and perspective. Examples
      are fetched from i.a. Greek and Egyptian materials.

    body: >-
      Ruth Mostern outlines humanities perspectives on place and place-making
      and how these can be operationalised in SRIs. The collaborative World
      Historical Gazetteer (WHG) project and its outputs serve as the main
      example. The talk focuses primarily on developing ontologies and
      vocabulary in a project setting e.g. Linked Places Format developed for
      the WHG.

Uppsala, Sweden

This workshop covers key concepts in the field of (spatial) digital research infrastructures in the Humanities such as spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data (LOD), metadata, ontology etc. It also outlines major challenges in the field and gives some concrete, authentic examples of how to overcome them in small and large-scale projects in both academia and the GLAM sector.
