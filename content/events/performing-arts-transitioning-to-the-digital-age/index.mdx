  **ABOUT**


  The transition process of cultural and artistic institutions, associations and individual artists to digital communication, which has been going on for several decades, has recently been further accelerated by various factors such as the pandemic or digital transformations of state institutions. Digital communication in the field of art, in addition to everyday, professional and administrative communication, which also includes promotional activities, encompasses shaping and presenting artistic work with the help of digital technologies and, afterward, digital processing and storage of administrative and archival material.


  Performing arts, which are considered intangible cultural heritage, are particularly difficult to adapt to this situation precisely because their value is largely manifested as the totality of all tangible elements (scenography, costume design, dramatic text, lighting, etc.), which at a specific moment in conjunction with the audience create a unique and intangible experience and expression. Extensive use of digital technology and communication platforms for theatrical performance implies a radical change in the communication code and requires a major adaptation of previously acquired and established knowledge. It also requires the acquisition of new knowledge, which is often not closely related to the arts and humanities.


  The conference aimed to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary connecting information sciences and computer science with the performing arts in the context of digital humanities while reflecting on the achievements so far on this path. Therefore, through three thematic blocks it was shown, among other things, how digital humanities tools can serve scholars in performing arts research, what is the relationship between digital technologies and theatrical performance and, finally, what are the possibilities of digital archiving and linking data on performing arts material on both national and international level. At the same time, the conference introduced members of the national theatre community, i.e. performing arts and theatre (i.e. performance) studies with leading international scholars and experts in the field.

      The workshop is aimed at performing artists, especially theatre actors and
      theatre audiences. It includes testing the prototype of the digital tool
      “e-spect@tor” and the performance of the hybrid play #WAR_DIARY, whose
      authors are actors from the Ukrainian Centre for Contemporary Art DAKH in
      Kyiv and the international Ukrainian festival Gogolfest. Croatian actors,
      participants of the workshop, worked on a textual template of the play,
      exploring the ways in which the Zoom platform can be used as a tool to
      enrich their performance.

      The research projects in digital humanities and digital theatre studies
      “L'École du Spectateur” and “Visual Staging”, jointly led by La Rochelle
      Université, Université de Lille and Université de Poitiers, work in
      collaboration with cognitive sciences and neurosciences in order to define
      and/or analyse a number of characteristics of the performing arts that the
      traditional research methods have not been able to detect or measure, such
      as the importance of the venue where the performance takes place, the
      relevance of the joint presence of the audience and the artist during a
      live show or the involvement of the emotions felt by the spectator in the
      appreciation of a performance.

      and Challenges
    speakers:
      - iveković-ozana
    body: >-
      This conference talk aims to outline the most important issues of the
      relations between theatre and performance studies and digital phenomena.
      Its primary goal is to give an overview of the possibilities that digital
      humanities can offer to theatre and performance studies. It also raises
      questions and depicts problems that this kind of approach implies, and it
      as well tries to offer tentative conclusions about the benefits that the
      encounter between theatre and performance studies on one hand and digital
      humanities on the other brings. Consequently, the goal is not to come to
      an obligatory conclusion, but rather to ask questions and provoke
      discussions that could help contribute to future studies.

  - title: "Challenges of Archiving Performing Arts: Eurokaz Digital Archive"
    speakers:
      - vnuk-gordana
    body: >-
      Eurokaz was a festival of new theatre that was founded in Zagreb in 1987
      and took place until 2013 when it was transformed into a producing house
      that is still active today. Thanks to a grant from the Kultura Nova
      Foundation the process of digitization of the festival archive has begun
      last year. It is a big challenge and we have encountered many problems due
      to a wide time span which amounts to 27 years of the festival's existence.
      During this period archiving technology was constantly changing and what
      we have today is a lot of material in different formats the content of
      which has to be adjusted to new standards. From press cuttings in paper
      form to CDs and DVDs and old websites for each year's program which are
      not supported anymore (like with Adobe Flash Player), not to mention old
      video tapes with recorded performances. It is a hefty workload and we
      assigned an IT expert to create a separate segment on the Eurokaz website,
      where our archive will be visible to a wider audience.

      Research Centre “IDOS_ARTS” and PhD in Data Science on Digital Humanities"
    speakers:
      - gavrilovich-donatella
    body: >-
      In the framework of the DARIAH-EU WG Theatralia compilation project of the
      International Theatrical Registry, I launched the RADATMAS project at the
      University of Rome “Tor Vergata” in February 2022. This is a randomized
      research study of the little town of Macerata and its surrounding area.
      Thanks to the RADATMAS census thirty-one theatre archives have been
      discovered, while in the Ministry of Italian Culture (MIC) SIUSA database
      there are only three archives. The same goes for the theatres: the census
      found forty-one theatres out of the twenty-three reported by the MIC. The
      census of theatres and theatrical archives located in the Macerata area as
      well as the organization of the collected data was completed in the summer
      of 2022. In September, a colleague from the AI Department joined the
      working group to jointly design the database of the Italian Theatres and
      Archives Registry.

  - title: The Potential of Computer Music in Theatre
    body: >-
      Since the first notion of the synergy between computer music and theatre
      in the 1980s, the potential of complementing these practices with each
      other has significantly grown along the steep trajectories of technical
      advancements and the influence of new media, generative art, and resulting
      aesthetics. In comparison to traditional musical forms, computer music
      allows previously unreachable levels of automation, control, interaction,
      and sonic diversity. Techniques like algorithmic composition (using formal
      rules to create music), data sonification (translating data into sound),
      live coding (writing computer code that generates music live in front of
      the audience), automation in multimediality, and various aspects of
      interactivity open novel opportunities in the context of theatre. This
      presentation gives a brief overview of predominant practices and trends in
      computer music with examples of their application to performing arts.

  - title: "Modelling of Theatrical Archives: Use of Linked Data in the
      Machine-Readable Representation of Theatrical Information"
    body: >-
      The aim of the project was to create a virtual encyclopaedic source of
      theatrical knowledge using Linked (Open) Data in order to include it in a
      wider network of cultural sources that provide theatrical information,
      within the framework of the Semantic Web. Using the Digitized Archive of
      the National Theatre of Greece as the reference archive, I tried enriching
      it through its semantic interconnections with digital sources that provide
      relevant knowledge. Some of the most notable existing theatre archives and
      databases have been researched as well as the users' informative demands
      influenced by the types of information that appear in each archive, such
      as biographies, productions, texts, and interviews. This talk introduces a
      conceptual model designed to be as adequate as possible to represent
      theatrical archives and to cover a sufficient range of offered theatrical
      information. The FRBR model was harmonised with the global CIDOC CRM
      cultural documentation standard to produce the FRBRoo object-oriented
      library ontology, with which the final model is partially compatible.

      - julien-frédéric

    body: >-
      As the holders of information about various entities in the performing
      arts sector, industry associations, unions and national institutions have
      a pivotal role to play in the data-centric performing arts sector. Since
      2020, the Canadian Association for the Performing Arts has supported more
      than 20 such “arts service organizations” in the implementation of best
      practices for data management and data sharing. As a result, information
      about 7,500 performers, designers, organizations and venues has been
      transformed from unstructured text into linked open data. This open data
      was then made available for reuse via an open knowledge graph called
      Artsdata and via Wikidata, an open knowledge base associated with the
      Wikimedia movement. This data-centric work has laid a foundation of data
      for reuse across performing arts archives and other performing arts
      applications. Although this information is not yet being used in
      performing arts archives, CAPACOA proved this concept with its LIVE
      Performing Arts Directory, a directory entirely populated by open data.

      Responding to challenges and turning crises into new opportunities have
      become the leading features of CCA Dakh / FCA GogolFest. Laboratory of
      Solutions in Digital, created at the beginning of the global Covid
      pandemic, began as simple attempts to combine theatre and digital reality
      in Zoom. Then, the team managed to create digital repertoires and become
      an example of digital theatre in Ukraine. Streaming ready-made
      performances and installations, implementing digital technologies in
      performances, and international online collaborations became the ways to
      survive when the theatre was impossible to visit and, consequently, became
      a development strategy. The theatre is becoming an intersection of
      different industries, science, literature, visual arts, education, and a
      voice of social challenges. In the reality of Ukraine, digital theatre is
      also becoming an important cultural element of the struggle.

    body: >-
      Departing from traditional archives based on the analysis of material
      artefacts as the only credible sources in reconstructing past events and
      the characterization of a dance performance that “becomes through
      disappearance”, bodily archives follow the idea that a dance performance
      does leave a trace, only leaves it differently: relying on perceptive and
      receptive mechanisms observers, interpreters, participants in the
      performance. Reliance on recollection and bodily tools such as
      observation, memorization, and evocation in the reconstruction of events
      are just as reliable or just as unreliable as reliance on archived
      material remains, because the material remains do not tell about what was
      excluded from the archive and why it was excluded, and are always in the
      service of construction, which implies an interpretation, a narrative, and
      not reconstruction of real events.

      The talk provides an introductory exploration of current PhD research
      being conducted into the information-seeking behaviours of dance
      researchers as well as the practice of dance archivists, to inform any
      future developments of online dance archives resources. This talk
      encompasses a UK-centric exploration of dance archives, dance archive
      professionals, and dance researchers, along with a careful outline of the
      methodological approach adopted within the project. The talk also explores
      the challenges faced in bringing both UK dance researchers and dance
      archivists together during a global pandemic, whilst providing a
      commentary on the impact the research could have on the transition to a
      digital future for dance archives.

    body: >-
      The Elementary School for Classical Ballet and Contemporary Dance at OŠ
      Vežica presented the world premiere of the dance-film fairy tale The
      Journey of Halima at Art-Kino, Rijeka on 11 February 2023. It was directed
      by Kate Foley, with visual effects and editing by Damjan Šporčić. It was
      filmed with 110 young dancers, six adults and eight choreographers during
      the pandemic in 2021. The original score by Zoran Majstorović features the
      musical traditions and instruments of the contemporary migrant trail from
      Mesopotamia to Northern Europe. The Journey of Halima is based on the
      children's book of the same name by Nikos Kalaitzidis with Michalis
      Darnakis, Maria Laftsidou, and Andreas Mavridis, written to empower
      refugee children. This hybrid form of dance documentation marked a triumph
      over a difficult period of compromise in which dance education suffered
      from poor digital tools and inadequate space, 19 where Viber and Microsoft
      Teams clashed with poor reception in cramped hallways, bedrooms and
      kitchens. It also delivers this theatrical effort in a more durable and
      shareable form than the original stage production could have ever
      accomplished.

  - title: Costume in a Virtual Environment
    body: >-
      Costume as an installation, costume as a performance, costume as the main
      protagonist in a digital environment – these are my artistic interests as
      a visual artist and costume designer. My presentation, therefore, is based
      on the overview of my artistic work in the field of costume design across
      various media, discourses, and contexts, advanced over the past twelve
      years as the result of merging ideas and experiences from different
      artistic fields, and of striving to overcome and expand the traditional
      approaches in costume design and drama theatre. The presentation is
      illustrated by a selection of my costume designs and projects created
      beyond the boundaries of mainstream theatre stages and productions, but
      the central part is dedicated to my most recent work, the series of video
      performances developed during the Covid pandemic and united under the
      joint title “Ivana Bakal – The Visual Theatre”, part one and two.

      and Learning"
    body: >-
      Today, more than ever, the trend of digitization is noted. During the
      Covid 19 pandemic we have all turned to video content and communication
      over the Internet. For many independent artists in Croatia, the initial
      reaction to the new pandemic conditions induced fear and insecurity. After
      the initial fear and shock, adaptation followed. More and more independent
      theatre artists and troupes felt the need to digitize the theatre so that
      under the current conditions as many people as possible can still find a
      way to follow theatre programs. This presentation touches upon the acting
      processes that take place in the artist when they rely on digital media.
      This presentation is also a reflection of the past two years of learning
      and growth.

  - title: Fuzzy Temporality and What to Do With the Rest, lecture performance
    speakers:
      - zenzerović-igor
    body: >-
      In what form will performance art, a discipline that once strived to be
      present and ephemeral at the same time, survive the transfer into the
      digital? This lecture is a form of warning that tries to balance alarmist
      technophobia and radical instances of digital humanism. By using
      anti-humanist thought and (non)concepts the artist tries to reconcile his
      fears and his work into the new archival dynamic that is yet to come.
      Calling into question the remains, traces and spectres of immanence and
      ephemerality in performance art, the artist opens his own fears and wounds
      of time. Using his own artistic experience in durational performances,
      theoretical knowledge and some elements of lecture performance, the artist
      presents the fuzzy and indeterminate materiality of performance art as a
      means of survival within the digital.

15 - 17 March, Zagreb, Croatia

The conference aimed to examine the possibilities of connecting information sciences and computer science with performing arts, focusing on three thematic blocks:- archiving, artistic practices and scholarly research. The international scientific and professional conference is part of the project of the same name by the DARIAH-EU Working Group Theatralia, which is dedicated to the research of digital technology in the performing arts and the digitization of theatralia, financed from DARIAH-EU funds.
