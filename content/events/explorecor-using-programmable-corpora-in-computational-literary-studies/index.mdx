abstract: This three-day training school organised by the CLS Infra project
  focused on dynamic collections of literary texts manipulated programmatically.
  Learners will learn to find, evaluate, and select corpora using tools like
  CLSCor and DraCor, and gain skills in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, API querying,
  Linked Open Data, and Digital Literary Network Analysis. The training
  addresses reproducibility using Docker, promoting transparent, replicable
  research in Computational Literary Studies.

  ## About the Training School 

  The academic training school, "ExploreCor: Using Programmable Corpora in
  Computational Literary Studies," took place in Vienna in June 2024, spanning
  three intensive days. The unique programme was designed to provide
  participants with a comprehensive understanding of the research cycle in
  Computational Literary Studies, equipping them with the skills needed to
  navigate the evolving landscape of digital humanities.


  The training school began by delving into the critical process of finding and evaluating corpora of literary texts. Participants explored the concept of Programmable Corpora, a pivotal aspect of the curriculum. Programmable Corpora are dynamic collections of literary works that can be manipulated programmatically, allowing for customised and nuanced analyses.


  The curriculum progressed to the formulation of research questions and the subsequent execution of analyses using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Attendees utilised the tool DraCor, designed for efficient and flexible literary text analysis. Additionally, the training incorporated the clsCor catalogue, a Linked Data-powered resource developed within the CLS INFRA project, enabling students to explore and select corpora for their research.


  An integral component of the training focused on APIs and Linked Data, emphasising the interconnected nature of literary datasets. Students engaged in exemplary research projects using the DraCor system, gaining hands-on experience in navigating digital literary networks. The training school addressed the issue of Repeatable Research, a challenge in the Digital Humanities landscape, and explored methods to ensure research replicability.


  Digital Literary Network Analysis is a key topic covered in the programme, providing participants with the tools to uncover intricate relationships within literary texts. A dedicated segment addressed the Reproducibility Crisis in Digital Humanities, underscoring the importance of transparent and replicable research practices.


  To ensure the longevity and accessibility of research outcomes, the training school introduced Docker as a valuable tool. Participants learnt how to leverage Docker to encapsulate their research environments, enhancing the reproducibility of their findings.


  By combining theoretical foundations with practical applications, participants left equipped to navigate the complexities of programmable corpora, digital literary analysis, and reproducible research, contributing to the ongoing advancement of the field.

      ##Abstract

      A key component of Programmable Corpora is the research-driven API, which makes it particularly easy to retrieve and process corpus data that have been generated for specific research questions. The DraCor API was developed especially for the network analysis method.  This session introduces the method of network analysis and presents the DraCor API and its possibilities in detail.

      ## Abstract


      As a result of the so-called "reproducibility crisis" making research repeatable has become a crucial topic in empirical and technical sciences. In Computational Literary Studies (CLS), there is still a shortage of both a culture of repetitive research and user-friendly technical solutions. In this talk Christof Schöch introduces a theoretical framework to describe modes of repeating research in Digital Humanities.

      ##Abstract

      This session demonstrates how to use the available Docker images of DraCor and GitHub to setup stable local DraCor corpora to allow for replication of research. After viewing this session, learners should be able to create their own custom corpora and learn about strategies for sharing them.
