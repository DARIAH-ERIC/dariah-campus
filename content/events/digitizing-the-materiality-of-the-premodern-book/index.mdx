abstract: The foundational skills at the intersection of digitization,
  bibliography, and the Digital Humanities are crucial for many scholars, yet
  instruction frequently only covers one or maybe two of these intersecting
  aspects. For example, use of the Text Encoding Initiative XML standard is
  increasingly the norm in digital scholarly editing, but many individuals
  working with textual materials do not have access to relevant scholarly
  training in DH. Conversely, many DH departments, lack rare book specialists.
  The goal of this workshop was to create one succinct class where students will
  learn the necessary skills for understanding how the materiality of pre-modern
  books can be digitized and provide a foundation for putting those skills into
  practice. After attending this workshop, students will understand the
  fundamentals of digitization and how books and manuscripts are described in
  the TEI, including the msdescription and transcription modules. The workshop
  as an in-person event was used to create the materials that were made into
  this video class for self-study.
