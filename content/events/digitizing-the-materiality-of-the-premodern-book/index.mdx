abstract: The foundational skills at the intersection of digitization,
  bibliography, and the Digital Humanities are crucial for many scholars, yet
  instruction frequently only covers one or maybe two of these intersecting
  aspects. For example, use of the Text Encoding Initiative XML standard is
  increasingly the norm in digital scholarly editing, but many individuals
  working with textual materials do not have access to relevant scholarly
  training in DH. Conversely, many DH departments, lack rare book specialists.
  The goal of this workshop was to create one succinct class where students will
  learn the necessary skills for understanding how the materiality of pre-modern
  books can be digitized and provide a foundation for putting those skills into
  practice. After attending this workshop, students will understand the
  fundamentals of digitization and how books and manuscripts are described in
  the TEI, including the msdescription and transcription modules. The workshop
  as an in-person event was used to create the materials that were made into
  this video class for self-study.

      This module of the course "Digitizing the Materiality of the Pre-Modern
      Book" provides an introduction to book history, addressing the central
      question: What is a book? The module traces the evolution from ancient
      stone inscriptions and scrolls to the modern digital age, where texts are
      accessed digitally  by "scrolling". 


      Erich Renhart initiates the module with an introduction to book history, illustrated by examples from  the University of Graz's Special Collections. 


      Megan Piorko continues the discussion, questioning  our perceptions of what consitutes books and texts. She explores the materiality of books, emphasizing the need to understand historical books beyond basic bibliographical metadata like author, title, year and publisher. Her sessions on descriptive bibliography, divided into a theoretical and practical parts, delve into the structure of early modern books. The theoretical session discusses the methodology for bibliographical description, while the practical session involves hands-on descriptive bibliography using the University of Graz's collection.
