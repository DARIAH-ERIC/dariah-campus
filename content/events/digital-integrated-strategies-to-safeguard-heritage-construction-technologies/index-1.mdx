abstract: The international workshop DIGITAL INTEGRATED STRATEGIES TO SAFEGUARD
  HERITAGE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES is funded by the “DARIAH Funding Scheme for
  Working Group Activities 2023-2025” programme, which supports the Working
  Groups of DARIAH ERIC, specifically the new ARCHETIPO Working Group,
  encouraging the development of innovative projects, new services, tools, and
  training activities.
about: >-
  Theoretical Sessions and Lectures:


  Participants will have the opportunity to attend theoretical sessions and lectures conducted by experts. These sessions will provide an in-depth overview of theories, concepts, and best practices in the field of architectural heritage conservation. Topics might include surveying methodologies, digital modelling techniques, conservation principles, and much more. This part of the day will provide a theoretical foundation for the practical activities in the afternoon.




  Practical Field Activities and Data Processing:


  In the afternoon, participants will move to the field to put into practice what they have learned during the theoretical sessions. They will be guided by experts through practical surveying activities and analysis of building evidence directly on the historical site of Poggioreale. Once the field activities are completed, participants will have the opportunity to return to the laboratory to process and analyze the collected data. They will use specialized software to create digital models, visualize results, and conduct in-depth analyses. This part of the workshop will allow participants to acquire practical skills and work directly with cutting-edge tools and technologies.




  Areas of Application:


  Documentation, conservation, and enhancement of architectural heritage, historic centers, instrumental surveying systems, scan to BIM.

The workshop, organized by the Institute of Heritage Science of the CNR, in collaboration with the Cyprus Institute and the University of Catania, with the support of the Municipality of Poggioreale, is dedicated to discussing and developing initiatives to improve the conservation and management of cultural heritage through advanced digital technologies, promoting collaboration among various working groups and resource sharing.

The workshop aims to promote a digital approach to the conservation, restoration, and reuse of tangible and intangible heritage knowledge related to construction technologies. The event intends to strengthen ties with local communities, including scholars, researchers, and authorities, facilitating the exchange of knowledge in the fields of architecture and Digital Humanities. The expected outcomes will contribute to DARIAH’s mission of advancing research in the humanities through the development of original databases, access to resources, and the development of digital skills. The dissemination of the knowledge produced by the workshop through the DARIAH-Campus will increase the visibility and accessibility of digital methodologies and strategies.

During the workshop, discussions and practical field sessions will focus on implementing digital methodologies and strategies in researching informational models capable of systematically representing the rules and systems of construction art in specific geographic and historical contexts within the European territory. The potential of HBIM (Heritage Building Information Modelling) will be explored as a key tool in architectural heritage management and restoration, applying best practices in data acquisition, management, and sharing processes.

The workshop will bring together international experts in the fields of architecture, engineering, conservation, and technology to explore the potential of HBIM modelling as a key tool in managing and restoring historical buildings. Participants will have the opportunity to learn the best practices in the data acquisition process, from 3D scanning to data collection, and the subsequent creation of BIM models respecting good practices of knowledge representation for data interoperability.
