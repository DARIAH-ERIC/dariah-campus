This is where the content for your training resource begins. This sample resource contains guidance on all of the syntax you should need to use when creating your resource. If you have additional needs, there are many markdown guides online, and the DARIAH-Campus team are happy to give advice and guidance.

## Use second-level headings for main sections

This section is on basic text formatting. Do not use first-level headings: they are reserved for the title of the resource, which is picked up directly from your YAML metadata above.

To create paragraphs simply:

Insert a blank line to separate lines of text, just like above. Do not indent new paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

You create **bold text** like this, using double asterisks, before and after the word or phrase. To italicise text you _use single asterisks_ like this. You can create **_bold and italic_** using triple asterisks.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> like this
>
> To include multiple paragraphs in the blockquote, add a > on the blank line inbetween as above.

Leave a line after the block quote.

Ordered lists:

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

Bullet point lists:

- Item
- Item
- Item

To create code blocks, wrap the block with triple-backticks. Optionally, add the code language to get syntax highlighting for supported languages.

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
</html>
```

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [click here]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://dariah.eu)).

To find training resources [click here](https://dariah.eu).

To denote a word or phrase as code,within a line encase it in tick marks like `<this>`

## Heading level two

This section concerns images.

You can insert an image as below:

![Description of image](images/imagename.png)

The path or URL to the image asset is in parentheses. The text in square brackets is the alt text.

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

[![Description of image](images/imagename.png)](https://linktotheimage.eu)

### Heading level three

This section concerns videos.

To insert a YouTube video, use the following code:

<VideoCard
  title="Title of the Video"
  id="SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s"
  image="images/imagename.jpg"
/>

The "id" is the part of the url after the equals sign for a YouTube video. So, for "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s" it is: "SI3u9nu7YEY&t=164s".

"image" allows you to choose a screenshot that will appear until the learner clicks the play button.

An alternative is to directly embed the video from YouTube, which you do in the following way:

<Youtube id="OqYJNUmhJzw" caption="Laurent Romary (Former DARIAH Director)" />

If you are including multiple videos, you might choose to arrange them in a grid formation. You can do this in the following way:

<Grid columns="3">

<Youtube id="OqYJNUmhJzw" caption="Laurent Romary (Former DARIAH Director)" />
<Youtube id="iwz0uhEhtg4" caption="Jennifer Edmond (DARIAH Director)" />
<Youtube id="soL0itkLYpk" caption="Frank Fischer (DARIAH Director)" />

</Grid>

#### Heading level four

Some extended syntax.

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

To add footnotes:

A simple footnote is created like this,[^1] and a longer one like this.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Longer footnote with extra details and description.

Any questions can be directed to the DARIAH-Campus editors at any time in the preparation process.
