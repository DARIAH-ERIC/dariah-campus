description: Axel Jean-Caurant is a research engineer at the L3i laboratory of
  the University of La Rochelle. He obtained his PhD in computer science in
  2018. The focus of his thesis was on the accessibility of documents inside
  digital libraries. The large number of online available digital documents has
  changed how researchers think about information and research. The focus of his
  work was put on two distinct aspects. First is to understand how researchers
  use these online platforms and how to train them to understand the changes
  data has undergone during the digitisation processes. Second, is the study of
  the impact of the quality of documents on accessibility. Axel is now focusing
  his work on historical press. Axel is interested in all the potential
  processing steps, from layout analysis to named entity recognition, to better
  understand these documents.
