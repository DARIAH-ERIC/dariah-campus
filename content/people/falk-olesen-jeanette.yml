description: >-
  PhD fellow at Department of Digital Design and Information Studies at Aarhus
  University. During her PhD project, she has researched how design processes
  are influenced and accelerated by both game jam and hackathon formats. She
  uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to gain insights into these
  accelerated design processes, including participating in game jams and
  hackathons herself. Her work has included studying how game jam and hackathon
  formats can be adapted to facilitate creativity and support academic
  processes, such as teaching, learning and researching. Her research interests
  include how processes of imagining, designing and developing technology can be
  democratised for example via formats which accelerates design processes, and
  via maker materials which lowers the barrier to technology development. She is
  also one of the founders of an Aarhus-based game development meet-up group,
  called GOLD.
