  Piroska Lendvai studied Anglo-Saxon and Slavic philology (Pécs, Hungary).
  Being inspired by seminal science fiction literature such as 'Blade Runner'
  and 'Neuromancer', she decided to do a PhD in a field that combines languages
  and AI - natural language processing (Tilburg, Netherlands). After spending
  several years on training algorithms to understand what people do when they
  must talk to a machine, for example about about train connections ('Computer,
  I never told you I wanted to go to Mügli am See! Restart again!'), or when
  they must sort zoology metadata into museum databases ('Computer, 'dead humid
  leaves' should be the finding place of this animal, not the cause of its
  death!'), she decided to go back to her roots, and has taken up a position at
  the Research Institute for Linguistics (Budapest, Hungary). Currently, she is
  affiliated to the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel
  (Switzerland), where she supports research in Humanities and Social Sciences
  via tools and approaches from language technology.
