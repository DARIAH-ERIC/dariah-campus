  Moniek’s research focuses mainly on absorbing reading experiences. She did her
  PhD in empirical literary studies at Utrecht University in The Netherlands,
  investigating the textual features that can lead to absorption during reading.
  Her first post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in
  Frankfurt, Germany focused on the personality traits that predict absorbed
  reading and the eye movement correlates of absorbed reading. She is currently
  a post-doctoral researcher at the Digital Humanities lab in Basel,
  Switzerland, where she is a PI on a SNSF-funded “Digital Lives” research
  project teaching machine learning algorithms to detect instances of absorption
  in online reader reviews. She is also a board member of IGEL (the
  International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature) in charge of
  their training school program, and a member of PALA (Poetics and Linguistics
  Association) and E-READ (Evolution of Reading in the Age of Digitization).
  Some of her other research interests involve (absorbed) reading and
  well-being, bibliotherapy, story literacy, reading habits, and psychometrics.
