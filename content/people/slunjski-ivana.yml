description: >
  Ivana Slunjski is a performing arts critic, dance researcher and theorist. She
  develops the concept of a research-archival model based on the idea of
  “archiving the present” with the intention of creating a database for further
  artistic, scientific or other research, finding methodologies for monitoring,
  documenting and analyzing the artistic process. Since the beginning of her
  career, she has participated in many interdisciplinary projects as an author
  and occasionally as a performer, and collaborates with choreographers as a
  dramaturg and as a screenwriter on a dance film as well. She is currently
  thinking about new reception formats and tools with which criticism and
  theatre studies would respond in a timely manner to the shifts in the
  performing arts towards processuality, sharing of practices, and digital
  performance.
