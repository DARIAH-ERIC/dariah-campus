description: "Silvie’s background is German and Swedish philology. She entered
  academia dreaming of a lifetime among medieval manuscripts - until a lecture
  on Corpus Linguistics and text search demo threw her off that path! Silvie has
  since joined the Charles University Institute of Formal and Applied
  Linguistics (Faculty of Mathematics and Physics). She has been captivated by
  the power of linguistic annotation and query languages, and they have even
  inspired her to learn some statistics and coding."
