description: "Sara Ellis-Nilsson is Associate Professor of Early History at
  Linnaeus University. Her research interests are interdisciplinary and include
  cultural heritage, cultural history, material culture, hagiography/liturgy,
  and digital humanities. She is the project leader of the Swedish Research
  Council funded, 'digitisation and accessibility of cultural heritage
  collections' (DIGARV) project, 'Mapping Lived Religion: Medieval Cults of
  Saints in Sweden and Finland'. The project runs from 2019-2024. As part of
  this project, I will be studying the development of special feast days, their
  role in lived religion, and their connection to lay piety. From 2021-2023, I
  was one of the co-leads of the project and initiative, 'Nordic Spatial
  Humanities: Linking, Building, and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial
  Infrastructures for Research in the Nordic Countries'. Working together with
  the PI at Uppsala University and co-leads at the University of Bergen and the
  University of Iceland, we have generated dialogue and exchange between
  academic and non-academic sectors, focusing on the needs of the humanities in
  terms of spatial data and data infrastructures for research and
  dissemination."
