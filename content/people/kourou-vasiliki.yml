  Vasiliki Kourou studied Linguistics and just completed her Master's degree in
  Digital Methods for the Humanities at the Athens University of Economics and
  Business. Throughout her involvement with plenty of digital humanities topics,
  she detected an absence of development in the field of digital culture and art
  and so, she decided to conduct her thesis entitled “Modelling of Theatrical
  Archives: Use of Linked Data in the Machine-readable Representation of
  Theatrical Information”, trying to suggest a way to upgrade existing
  theatrical archives, through their semantic interconnection. She was attracted
  to the field of Digital Humanities since it gives her the opportunity to
  combine her acquired knowledge in the humanities with digital methods. She is
  a theatre enthusiast and thrilled by art in all its forms. From the very early
  of her career, she was fascinated by conceptual modelling and the semantic
  organization of data. She is dedicated to continuing her academic path as a
  researcher with a special interest in digital culture and the impact that
  digital capabilities and innovation could have on the humanities.
