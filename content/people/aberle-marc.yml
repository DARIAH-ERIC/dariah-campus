  Marc Aberlé works at the University of Neuchâtel as a member of the SNF-funded
  [Reformation, local assemblies and ballots](http://p3.snf.ch/project-162968)
  project. He is currently writing a PhD thesis about the link between
  Protestantism and Democracy. In order to deliver a better understanding of
  this relation, he analyses the complex thought patterns and intellectual
  networks at the core of this idea, which brought many protestant thinkers and
  political actors to find themselves sharing common values.
