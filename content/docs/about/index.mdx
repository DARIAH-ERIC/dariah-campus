## What is DARIAH-Campus?

DARIAH-Campus is both a _discovery framework_ and a _hosting platform_ for DARIAH and DARIAH-affiliated offerings in training and education.

The goal of DARIAH-Campus is to widen access to open, inclusive, high-quality learning materials that aim to enhance creativity, skills, technology and knowledge in the digitally-enabled arts and humanities.

DARIAH-Campus started as a pilot project exploring different ways of capturing and consolidating DARIAH learning resources within the H2020-funded project DESIR (DARIAH-ERIC Sustainability Refined).

The beta version of DARIAH-Campus was released on November 6th, 2019 at the DESIR Event in Zagreb.  In 2021, new features were added to the site to include the addition of curricula, and a new Content Management System to make edits to the site easier for content-providers.

If you have learning resources that you would like to share on or create for DARIAH-Campus, feel free to get in touch with us to discuss next steps.
