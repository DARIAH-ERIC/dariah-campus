# Picking the appropriate Resource type

So you want to make a contribution to DARIAH-Campus?

That’s great!

Here are the steps you need to go through in order to get your contribution published. If you have training materials, or events that you would like to contribute to DARIAH-Campus, you can do so in a number of ways.

View the flowchart below to see what kind of resource you want to contribute.

Once you know what kind of contribution you’d like to make, you can submit your proposal.

# Submitting your proposal

If you have a resource in mind, you first need to send us some information so that we can set things up for you to get started.

1.	If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you should register for one, as you will need this to complete the entire contribution process.

2.	You will need to fill in the form found here: [Propose a Resource form](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-campus/issues/new?assignees=ttasovac%2CVickyGarnett&labels=new+resource&template=propose_resource.yml&title=%5Bnew+resource%5D%3A+)

This will ask you for the following information:
* **Title of resource**
* All people to be listed as **authors, contributors or editors** (no need to distinguish which at this stage, we just want the names!)
* If you need to add a new **Organisation** to DARIAH-Campus, please give us the name, a logo and a URL for the Organisation website.
* **Type of resource** (External Resource / Hosted Resource / Pathfinder / Captured Event)
* Any **new tags** you want to add to the list (please ensure that your tag isn't already listed on DARIAH-Campus - [the full list is here](/tags))
* The **Learning Outcomes** that users will experience by engaging with your resource (typically 2-4 different outcomes)
* **Brief Abstract** for the resource (approx 50 words max)
* The names of any organisations (e.g. research institutes, research infrastructures, projects) that will be named in your resource (this is particularly pertinent to Captured Events)

3.	Submit your form on GitHub and we will get back to you **within a week** to let you know when you can start the next step.

# Next steps
Once your information is set up ready, we will send you a notice via GitHub.  You can then start adding your resources to DARIAH-Campus.  There are two ways you can do this.  We strongly recommend using the [Content Management System](https://dariah-campus-six.vercel.app/docs/using-the-content-management-system), especially if you are not familiar or confident using GitHub.  If you do want to use GitHub and need guidance, we have some instructions for use **here [link to “Using GitHub directly” in the documentation]**.
