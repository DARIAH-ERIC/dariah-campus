This if where you can write a bit of background information about the curriculum.  You can start off by introducing the overarching topic of the curriculum, and then describe the main points that it will cover through the different resources that are linked below.&#x20;

## House Style and Section Headings

If you choose to add any headings, make sure they stick within the house style, starting with 'Heading 2' for main headings, and then using subsequent sub-headings accordingly.&#x20;

### Widgets

As mentioned, you probably won't need to use widgets in a curriculum, but if you need to add any images, such as funding or stakeholder logos, you can do so using the appropriate widget from the widget menu above.  Remember all images should be accompanied by an image description, or 'alt-text' unless they are decorative or redundant (have already been explained in the content text).

## Acknowledgements

You may choose to give acknowledgements of any funding that was used to develop the resources and curriculum. &#x20;
