### Cookies

To make this site work properly, we may place small data files called cookies on your device.

#### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

We use cookies for the following purposes:

- DARIAH-Campus only uses cookies as part of the Google Analytics on the site to track site use.
  - If you opt out of tracking from Google Analytics (see below), we set a cookie to remember this setting each time you visit our website again.
- Some videos embedded in our pages use a cookie to anonymously gather statistics on how you got there and what videos you visited. Enabling these cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience. You can delete or block these cookies if you prefer. Disabling cookies shouldn't affect the performance of DARIAH-Campus.

### Google Analytics

DARIAH ERIC uses Google Analytics to keep track of the DARIAH-Campus website performances over time. Every time a user visits our website, web analytics software generates an anonymous analytics cookie which tells us whether or not you have visited the site before.

These cookies cannot be used to identify individuals. They're used for statistical purposes only.

However, the data generated by these cookies, concerning your use of the site will be sent to Google and stored on servers located in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of assessing your use of the site, compiling reports on website activity for the website operator, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

Google may also provide this information to outside parties if legally required to do so or if such parties process this information on Google's behalf, in particular the site operator. Google will not match your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may deactivate the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. To provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics, Google has developed the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
