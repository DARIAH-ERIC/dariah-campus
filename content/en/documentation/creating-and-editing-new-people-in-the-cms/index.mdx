lead: How to add or edit 'people' profiles in the CMS.

Now that you are familiar with what the different buttons on the Dashboard do, you can start to draft up and edit content.  For the most part this will be creating new learning resources, but it is also possible that you will have to create or edit a ‘person’ profile.  For reasons that will become apparent as we move through this guide, it is best to either make sure that all the people you want to list as authors, contributing authors and/or editors for your resource are already in the system, or to add them in your ‘New Resource Branch’ first before you make a start on the content of your resource.  We therefore begin with this process.

## Check for Existing ‘People’ Files

Before you begin creating any new ‘Person’ profile, you need to first check that they aren’t already in the system, in order to avoid duplications.  You can do this in the CMS and also on the main DARIAH-Campus website.  But, as we are discussing the CMS here, we will focus on that method.

From the dashboard, select the ‘People’ option.  This will bring you to the full list of data files of individual people.  As there are over 600 people in the system, you will not see everyone on this screen, so you will have to go searching for them.  The list is in alphabetical order by surname/family name, so you can check through the list this way.  Alternatively (and more quickly!) you can use the search function above the list on the right hand side.  Once you start typing, it will automatically whittle the list down to potential ‘people’.

  Do bear in mind that some non-English spellings may have been ‘anglicised’ to make them more unix friendly, so letters such as ‘ð’, ‘œ’, ‘ü’ or ‘æ’ may have been re-cast as ‘d’, ‘oe’, ‘ue’ or ‘a’.  An example could be the name ‘Wünsche’ spelled ‘Wuensche’, or ‘Sigurðarsson’ becoming ‘Sigurdarsson’

## Creating a New ‘People’ file

If you have verified that the person you want to add definitely isn’t already in the system, you can proceed to add them.

In all cases when adding a new resource, or adding a new person, you want to create a new ‘branch’.  To do this, first go to the **dashboard**.

On the main window, you will see the branch you are currently on indicated in the box above all the buttons for resource types.  This is usually the ‘main’ branch.  Check to make sure you are already on the ‘main’ branch first, and then click on the ‘New Branch’ button underneath.  A pop-up window will appear.  Fill this in with the name of the branch you want to work on.

  Make sure you put a hyphen between words in a branch title, not a space, as the space character is not recognised in GitHub!

Once you have hit the ‘create’ button, you will notice that there is now a new button underneath the ‘current branch’ window on the dashboard, as shown in (1) on the image below.
