## Getting to Know the DARIAH-Campus Dashboard

The content management system (version launched in March 2025) allows users to create new resources and make changes to people profiles using the same basic workflow as creating, pushing and pulling commits on GitHub, but through a more user-friendly interface that does not require any experience or knowledge of coding practices.  No changes are published to DARIAH-Campus without the approval of the Editorial Board, and any changes you do make remain in a ‘branch’ that is separate from the main DARIAH-Campus website until it is ‘merged’ (published).  This means that you can work on your resource without worrying too much about making any catastrophic changes that break the DARIAH-Campus website, as the editorial team won’t let it get that far!

However, it is worth spending a bit of time getting to know the ‘Dashboard’ of the content management system (CMS) and what each section does in terms of moving your draft resource into a place where it can be reviewed and ultimately published.

Once your proposal has been submitted, and the basic information you need has been put into the repository, you can start to build up your resources.

1. Go to [DARIAH-Campus CMS](https://campus.dariah.eu/admin) and log in using your GitHub account. 
2. If this is the first time you’ve used the CMS, you will see this page inviting you to log in using your GitHub account:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/introduction-to-the-dariah-campus-content-management-system/1.-cms-documentation-first-screen.png" alt="Log in with GitHub" alignment="center">

</Figure>

You will then be asked to allow the system access to your GitHub account.  You will also be asked if you want to “Fork the Repo” or “Don’t fork the Repo”.  You should select “Fork the Repo”, as shown in this page:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/introduction-to-the-dariah-campus-content-management-system/2.-cms-documentation-screen-2.png" alt="At the top is the text 'DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS by DARIAH-ERIC would like permission to: Verify your GitHub Identity (Username). Know which resources you can access. Act on your behalf (here this is also a link shown with an option to learn more)'. Underneath is the text &#x22;learn more about DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. Underneath this are two buttons side by side.  On the left the button is in pale grey with black text saying 'Cancel'.  On the right is a green button with text in white saying 'Authorize DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. At the very bottom there is text saying 'Authorizing will redirect to https://campus.dariah.eu'." alignment="center">

</Figure>

You will then reach the homepage dashboard of the Content Management System, which looks like this:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/introduction-to-the-dariah-campus-content-management-system/3.-cms-dashboard-first-view.png" alt="The DARIAH-ERIC Keystatic CMS Dashboard.  The page is divided into two main sections.  On the left hand side, in a small column, are the main navigation options: Content, which includes 'Hosted Resources', 'External Resources', 'Pathfinders', 'Events', and 'Curricula'; Data, which includes 'people', 'sources', and 'tags'; and Pages, which includes 'Home Page' and 'Documentation'.  On the main window to the right of this menu at the top is a field indicating which 'branch' is currently in use.  Below that is the button to create a 'New Branch'.  Below this the main navigational options are presented once again, however they also have the option to make additions to the content." alignment="center">

</Figure>

On the left hand side are 4 key navigational elements.

</Figure>

### **The Branch selector**

At the top, (1) is a drop down menu which indicates the different branches.  This is usually set to ‘main’.  You use this drop down menu to move to different branches that contain different changes.  You cannot change to a different branch unless you are already on the Dashboard.

### **The Options button for branches**

Next to the branch selector, at the top of the navigation panel, is (2), the ‘Options’ buttons for branches, depicted as a square with three dots lined horizontally.  When you click on this button, different options for what to do with the branch will appear.  The options can vary depending on if you are on the main branch, or on a branch with edits.  This button will be explained further as we move through the steps for creating or editing a branch for edits to DARIAH-Campus.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Do note that you cannot edit the ‘Main Branch’ directly, as this is where the published resources exist.  Instead you always have to make edits using a new branch.
</Callout>

### **The Dashboard Button**

Below is the ‘dashboard’ button (3).  Click on this to return to the Home dashboard screen when you are editing a resource in the main window.

### **The Main Navigation**

Below the dashboard button is the main menu showing you what exists within the repository.  This is divided into 4 main groups: 

* Content, which includes 'Hosted Resources', 'External Resources', 'Pathfinders', 'Events', and 'Curricula'; 
* Data, which includes 'people', 'sources', and 'tags';
* Pages, which includes 'Home Page' and 'Documentation'
* Metadata, which includes ‘Navigation’ and ‘Metadata’

As a contributor, you will only ever need to focus on the ‘Content’ and ‘Data’ groups.  Any edits made to the other two groups will be rejected by the editorial team.

On the main window on the right hand side of the Dashboard are the same basic elements as in the navigation panel, but on this side they allow you to add new resources or people, or make edits to existing ones.  

At the top of this group is a box (5) indicating the **current** branch that you are on.  Underneath this box is a button that allows you to create a ‘New Branch’ (6).  

Beneath this are the creative elements for content (7), data (8), pages (9) and metadata (10).  Clicking on each element will bring you to a full list of the individual files, e.g. if you click on ‘hosted resources’ it will bring you to a full list of the hosted resources already published.  However, each option also has an add ( ‘+’ ) button within it.  Clicking on this 'add' option will allow you to create a new resource or file within that category.

The process for editing and creating a new branch and a new resource or data file will be outlined further in other sections of this documentation.

## Creating a New Branch (main section title)

In all cases when adding a new resource, or adding a new person, you want to create a new ‘branch’.  To do this, first go to the **dashboard**.

On the main window, you will see the branch you are currently on indicated in the box above all the buttons for resource types.  This is usually the ‘main’ branch.  Check to make sure you are already on the ‘main’ branch first, and then click on the ‘New Branch’ button underneath.  A pop-up window will appear.  Fill this in with the name of the branch you want to work on.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.1.-naming-new-branch.png" alt="A pop-up window in the CMS to name the new branch and a blue button to 'create'." alignment="center">

</Figure>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Make sure you put a hyphen between words in a branch title, not a space, as the space character is not recognised in GitHub!
</Callout>

Once you have hit the ‘create’ button, you will notice that there is now a new button underneath the ‘current branch’ window on the dashboard, as shown in (1) on the image below.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.2.-new-options-for-branch.png" alt="the main dashboard with a red outline around the 'Current Branch' field and a red number '1' to highlight the update to show the new branch name." alignment="stretch">

## Creating and Editing New People (Main page title)

Now that you are familiar with what the different buttons on the Dashboard do, you can start to draft up and edit content.  For the most part this will be creating new learning resources, but it is also possible that you will have to create or edit a ‘person’ profile.  For reasons that will become apparent as we move through this guide, it is best to either make sure that all the people you want to list as authors, contributing authors and/or editors for your resource are already in the system, or to add them in your ‘New Resource Branch’ first before you make a start on the content of your resource.  We therefore begin with this process.

## Check for Existing ‘People’ Files

Before you begin creating any new ‘Person’ profile, you need to first check that they aren’t already in the system, in order to avoid duplications.  You can do this in the CMS and also on the main DARIAH-Campus website.  But, as we are discussing the CMS here, we will focus on that method.

From the dashboard, select the ‘People’ option.  This will bring you to the full list of data files of individual people.  As there are over 600 people in the system, you will not see everyone on this screen, so you will have to go searching for them.  The list is in alphabetical order by surname/family name, so you can check through the list this way.  Alternatively (and more quickly!) you can use the search function above the list on the right hand side.  Once you start typing, it will automatically whittle the list down to potential ‘people’.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Do bear in mind that some non-English spellings may have been ‘anglicised’ to make them more unix friendly, so letters such as ‘ð’, ‘œ’, ‘ü’ or ‘æ’ may have been re-cast as ‘d’, ‘oe’, ‘ue’ or ‘a’.  An example could be the name ‘Wünsche’ spelled ‘Wuensche’, or ‘Sigurðarsson’ becoming ‘Sigurdarsson’
</Callout>

## Creating a New ‘People’ file

If you have verified that the person you want to add definitely isn’t already in the system, you can proceed to add them.


#### Entering Information in the 'People' Template

From here, you can now create a new person by clicking on the 'add' (‘ + ‘) symbol in the ‘People’ option.  The main panel will now change to the edit page for creating and modifying people profiles.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.3.-new-person-form-page.png" alt="&#x22;&#x22;" alignment="center">

</Figure>

You can fill in all the details for your new person, making sure that you fill in all the fields with an asterisk as these are required information.

Note, though, that the ‘slug’ field is automatically generated based on the name of the person.  You need to check that this fits the ‘**lastname-firstname**’ format that is used in DARIAH-Campus.  If it does not, you will need to change this manually.  Do not hit the ‘Regenerate’ button as this will reset the slug back to the incorrect form.

You can continue to enter information, making sure to also include an image for the person you are creating in the system, as is required.  We also encourage you to add a brief biography of the person in the ‘Description’ field.  This is not required, but if you intend to use them in an event, then it is good to include their biography here.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.5.-adding-a-new-image.png" alt="&#x22;&#x22;" alignment="center">

</Figure>

Once you have filled in the required information, and any additional information you wish to, you can hit the ‘Create’ blue button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.  This generates the file.  This button will change to ‘Save’ once you have done this.  From here you can now make additional changes to this file before you submit it for publication.

### Sending Your New ‘Person’ for Publication

When you have all the information required and you are happy with the profile, you can then move it through to the review stage for publication by creating a ‘Pull Request’.  However, if you are adding new people as part of a bigger contribution, such as creating a new learning resource or a ‘Captured Event’, you do not need to publish your new person just yet.  This will be done as part of the overall Pull Request that you generate for this new resource.

Navigate back to the ‘Dashboard’.  You will now see that there is a blue notice on the ‘People’ option to indicate that a change has been made in that directory.  

To create a Pull request, there are two options.  You can either click on the ‘Create Pull Request’ button immediately below the ‘Current Branch’ field in the main panel.  Alternatively you can also click on the three-dotted ‘Branch Option’ button at the top of the navigation panel to get a drop down menu, from where you can select ‘Create Pull Request’.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.9.-button-for-new-pull-request.png" alt="&#x22;&#x22;" alignment="center">

</Figure>

You can scroll down, as the gif below shows, to see all these changes.  You will also see a green button that says ‘Create Pull Request’.  Assuming you are happy that all the information in this commit is correct, you can hit that button, and a new pull request will be generated.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.11.-gif-of-pull-request-creation-person.gif" alt="a 'commit' showing all the information added to the new 'Person' file, and a cursor then clicks on the 'Create Pull Request' button and the generated Pull Request is briefly shown.  Gif on a loop." alignment="center">

</Figure>

This will now enable the editorial team to look at the new Person file you have created, and publish it.  They may also come back to you with questions or suggestions for changes within the ‘conversation’ page of this new pull request.  Once the editorial team has published your new Person file, the branch that you used to create it will be deleted from the CMS.

But for now, your work creating a new person is done!


## Editing an Existing Profile

Sometimes you might need to update a profile for a person.  This might be to change the image associated with them, or to add a 'Description' if they are to be included as an author or speaker in a Captured Event resource.

1. First make sure that the ‘Current Branch’ is set to ‘Main’, and create a new Branch, using the method outlined in '<Link link={{"discriminant":"url-fragment-id","value":"creating-new-branch"}}>Working on a New Branch</Link>'.  Make sure to give your branch a meaningful name that makes sense for the changes you want to make:

   <Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/creating-and-editing-new-people-in-the-cms/2.12.-creating-branch-to-edit-person-file.png" alt="&#x22;&#x22;" alignment="center">

   </Figure>
2. Find the person you want to update using the method outlined in <Link link={{"discriminant":"url-fragment-id","value":"Entering Information in the 'People' Template"}}>Entering Information in the 'People' Template</Link> above. Click on their profile, and you will be taken to the same editing page to work on.
3. Make the changes you need to.
4. Make sure that you click on the ‘Save’ button at the top, and then follow the same procedure as given above to create a new pull request (see <Link link={{"discriminant":"url-fragment-id","value":"Sending Your New ‘Person’ for Publication"}}>Sending Your New ‘Person’ for Publication)</Link>
