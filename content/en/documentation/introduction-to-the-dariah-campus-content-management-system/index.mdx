## Getting to Know the DARIAH-Campus Dashboard

The content management system (version launched in March 2025) allows users to create new resources and make changes to people profiles using the same basic workflow as creating, pushing and pulling commits on GitHub, but through a more user-friendly interface that does not require any experience or knowledge of coding practices. No changes are published to DARIAH-Campus without the approval of the Editorial Board, and any changes you do make remain in a 'branch' that is separate from the main DARIAH-Campus website until it is 'merged' (published). This means that you can work on your resource without worrying too much about making any catastrophic changes that break the DARIAH-Campus website, as the editorial team won't let it get that far!

However, it is worth spending a bit of time getting to know the 'Dashboard' of the content management system (CMS) and what each section does in terms of moving your draft resource into a place where it can be reviewed and ultimately published.

Once your proposal has been submitted, and the basic information you need has been put into the repository, you can start to build up your resources.

1. Go to [DARIAH-Campus CMS](https://campus.dariah.eu/admin) and log in using your GitHub account.
2. If this is the first time you've used the CMS, you will see this page inviting you to log in using your GitHub account:

</Figure>

You will then be asked to allow the system access to your GitHub account. You will also be asked if you want to "Fork the Repo" or "Don't fork the Repo". You should select "Fork the Repo", as shown in this page:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/introduction-to-the-dariah-campus-content-management-system/2.-cms-documentation-screen-2.png" alt="At the top is the text 'DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS by DARIAH-ERIC would like permission to: Verify your GitHub Identity (Username). Know which resources you can access. Act on your behalf (here this is also a link shown with an option to learn more)'. Underneath is the text 'learn more about DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. Underneath this are two buttons side by side.  On the left the button is in pale grey with black text saying 'Cancel'.  On the right is a green button with text in white saying 'Authorize DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. At the very bottom there is text saying 'Authorizing will redirect to https://campus.dariah.eu'." alignment="center">

You will then reach the homepage dashboard of the Content Management System, which looks like this:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/documentation/introduction-to-the-dariah-campus-content-management-system/3.-cms-dashboard-first-view.png" alt="The DARIAH-ERIC Keystatic CMS Dashboard.  The page is divided into two main sections.  On the left hand side, in a small column, are the main navigation options: Content, which includes 'Hosted Resources', 'External Resources', 'Pathfinders', 'Events', and 'Curricula'; Data, which includes 'people', 'sources', and 'tags'; and Pages, which includes 'Home Page' and 'Documentation'.  On the main window to the right of this menu at the top is a field indicating which 'branch' is currently in use.  Below that is the button to create a 'New Branch'.  Below this the main navigational options are presented once again, however they also have the option to make additions to the content." alignment="center">

On the left hand side are 4 key navigational elements.

### **The Branch selector**

At the top, (1) is a drop down menu which indicates the different branches. This is usually set to 'main'. You use this drop down menu to move to different branches that contain different changes. You cannot change to a different branch unless you are already on the Dashboard.

### **The Options button for branches**

Next to the branch selector, at the top of the navigation panel, is (2), the 'Options' buttons for branches, depicted as a square with three dots lined horizontally. When you click on this button, different options for what to do with the branch will appear. The options can vary depending on if you are on the main branch, or on a branch with edits. This button will be explained further as we move through the steps for creating or editing a branch for edits to DARIAH-Campus.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Do note that you cannot edit the 'Main Branch' directly, as this is where the published resources exist. Instead you always have to make edits using a new branch.
</Callout>

### **The Dashboard Button**

Below is the 'dashboard' button (3). Click on this to return to the Home dashboard screen when you are editing a resource in the main window.

### **The Main Navigation**

Below the dashboard button is the main menu showing you what exists within the repository. This is divided into 4 main groups:

* Content, which includes 'Hosted Resources', 'External Resources', 'Pathfinders', 'Events', and 'Curricula';
* Data, which includes 'people', 'sources', and 'tags';
* Pages, which includes 'Home Page' and 'Documentation'
* Metadata, which includes 'Navigation' and 'Metadata'

As a contributor, you will only ever need to focus on the 'Content' and 'Data' groups. Any edits made to the other two groups will be rejected by the editorial team.

On the main window on the right hand side of the Dashboard are the same basic elements as in the navigation panel, but on this side they allow you to add new resources or people, or make edits to existing ones.

At the top of this group is a box (5) indicating the **current** branch that you are on. Underneath this box is a button that allows you to create a 'New Branch' (6).

Beneath this are the creative elements for content (7), data (8), pages (9) and metadata (10). Clicking on each element will bring you to a full list of the individual files, e.g. if you click on 'hosted resources' it will bring you to a full list of the hosted resources already published. However, each option also has an add ( '+' ) button within it. Clicking on this 'add' option will allow you to create a new resource or file within that category.

The process for editing and creating a new branch and a new resource or data file will be outlined further in other sections of this documentation.
