## Getting to Know the DARIAH-Campus Dashboard

The content management system (version launched in March 2025) allows users to create new resources and make changes to people profiles using the same basic workflow as creating, pushing and pulling commits on GitHub, but through a more user-friendly interface that does not require any experience or knowledge of coding practices.  No changes are published to DARIAH-Campus without the approval of the Editorial Board, and any changes you do make remain in a ‘branch’ that is separate from the main DARIAH-Campus website until it is ‘merged’ (published).  This means that you can work on your resource without worrying too much about making any catastrophic changes that break the DARIAH-Campus website, as the editorial team won’t let it get that far!

However, it is worth spending a bit of time getting to know the ‘Dashboard’ of the content management system (CMS) and what each section does in terms of moving your draft resource into a place where it can be reviewed and ultimately published.

Once your proposal has been submitted, and the basic information you need has been put into the repository, you can start to build up your resources.

1. Go to [DARIAH-Campus CMS](https://campus.dariah.eu/admin) and log in using your GitHub account. 
2. If this is the first time you’ve used the CMS, you will see this page inviting you to log in using your GitHub account:

You will then be asked to allow the system access to your GitHub account.  You will also be asked if you want to “Fork the Repo” or “Don’t fork the Repo”.  You should select “Fork the Repo”, as shown in this page:

Know which resources you can access. Act on your behalf (here this is also a link shown with an option to learn more)'. Underneath is the text &#x22;learn more about DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. Underneath this are two buttons side by side.  On the left the button is in pale grey with black text saying 'Cancel'.  On the right is a green button with text in white saying 'Authorize DARIAH-Campus Keystatic CMS'. At the very bottom there is text saying 'Authorizing will redirect to https://campus.dariah.eu'." alignment="center">

You will then reach the homepage dashboard of the Content Management System, which looks like this:
