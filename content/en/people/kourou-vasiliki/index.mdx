Vasiliki Kourou studied Linguistics and just completed her Master's degree in Digital Methods for the Humanities at the Athens University of Economics and Business. Throughout her involvement with plenty of digital humanities topics, she detected an absence of development in the field of digital culture and art and so, she decided to conduct her thesis entitled “Modelling of Theatrical Archives: Use of Linked Data in the Machine-readable Representation of Theatrical Information”, trying to suggest a way to upgrade existing theatrical archives, through their semantic interconnection. She was attracted to the field of Digital Humanities since it gives her the opportunity to combine her acquired knowledge in the humanities with digital methods. She is a theatre enthusiast and thrilled by art in all its forms. From the very early of her career, she was fascinated by conceptual modelling and the semantic organization of data. She is dedicated to continuing her academic path as a researcher with a special interest in digital culture and the impact that digital capabilities and innovation could have on the humanities.
