Marc Aberlé works at the University of Neuchâtel as a member of the SNF-funded [Reformation, local assemblies and ballots](http://p3.snf.ch/project-162968) project. He is currently writing a PhD thesis about the link between Protestantism and Democracy. In order to deliver a better understanding of this relation, he analyses the complex thought patterns and intellectual networks at the core of this idea, which brought many protestant thinkers and political actors to find themselves sharing common values.
