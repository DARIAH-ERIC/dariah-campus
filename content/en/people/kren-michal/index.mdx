Michal, a mathematician by background, did his Ph.D. in linguistics at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.  Building, editing, annotating, and querying text corpora, as well as maintaining, customization and development of corpus tools, is his daily business at the Institute of the Czech National Corpus – and so is research!  Michal has matured along with the institute to serve his turn as department head, and he has extensive experience in teaching corpus linguistics and basic linguistic programming to humanities students.
