**Cesare Tocci is associate professor of Architectural Restoration at the Politecnico di Torino. His scientific research activity focuses on problems related to seismic safety of historical architecture, with specific regard to the themes of historical analysis, constructional survey and modelling of structural response of masonry buildings and, more generally, the themes related to the history of mechanics and its relation with architecture. He is the author of more than eighty publications on the cited topics.**

**He has worked, as a designer or consultant, on the structural aspects of different restoration projects (including the Cathedral of Noto, the church of San Nicolò l’Arena in Catania, the covering of the Julius Caesar’s Hall in Campidoglio in Rome, the church of San Pietro di Coppito in L’Aquila: for this latter project he has received the “Leonardo Paterna Baldizzi” award from the Accademia dei Lincei) and has contributed, as a collaborator or coordinator, to research projects on seismic vulnerability and construction history.**
