Loup BERNARD is teaching at the University of Strasbourg since 2007. His work as an archaeologist on the Celtic settlements and territories in Provence and Southern Germany led him to develop an online GIS, ArkeoGIS. It is a multilingual, multichronological online and free tool. The platform allows the aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share existing data between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over a decade of use, ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking open spatialized data and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to professional researchers.
