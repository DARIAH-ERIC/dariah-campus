Joe Bloggs is a made up person created purely for the purposes of demonstrating how to create people on the DARIAH CMS.  But, if he were a real person, let's say he graduated with a PhD in History, specifically history of women in the Industrial Revolution in the UK, from Manchester University in 2017.  He might have published in a few journals, and written a few books that have outlined digital humanities methods such as GIS use and corpus analysis.
