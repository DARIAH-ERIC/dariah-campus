Patrick Flack is the managing director of [sdvig press](https://sdvigpress.org/), an open access, non-profit academic publishing house. He is also associate member of the Central-European Institute for Philosophy (Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague). Since completing his PhD in 2011 (Comparative Literature, Charles University in Prague), he has worked in Helsinki, Leuven and Berlin as a post-doctoral researcher funded by the Swiss National Scientific Foundation. His research focuses on structuralism and a trans-cultural, interdisciplinary approach to its historiography. With sdvig press, he is currently developing a number of open access thematic platforms – such as the [Open Commons of Phenomenogy](http://ophen.org/) – designed to function as sustainable infrastructural and communication hubs for their respective scientific communities. The development of these platforms is linked directly with international institutions (Husserl Archives, Czech National Library, etc.), embedding their research projects, archival holdings and editorial outputs.
