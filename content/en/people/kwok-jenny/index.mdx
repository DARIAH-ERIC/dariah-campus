**Prof. Jenny Kwok** is an Assistant Professor at the Academy of Language and Culture, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU). She was awarded a CDH Visiting Fellowship at the University of Cambridge (2025) and will be a Gale Digital Scholar at the University of Oxford, 2026.

Prior to joining HKBU, she was Postdoctoral Fellow and later Research Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Arts, University of Hong Kong (HKU), where she also served as Lab Coordinator of the Arts Technology Lab. At HKU and HKBU, she contributed to the development of Digital Humanities teaching programs, including Introduction to digital humanities theories, tools, and methodologies, and advanced computational literary studies.

Her research explores how large language models can augment humanities inquiry, focusing on the intersection of AI and creative interpretation. She works on the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextualised reading of Irish Troubles poetry and on the design of AI workflows and agent-based systems for literary analysis. Her broader interests include creativity, generative AI, and the epistemic challenges posed by computational methods in the humanities. She has been invited to speak and deliver keynotes internationally, contributing perspectives on how computational advancements both challenge and renew humanistic practice. She also currently serves as a reviewer for several journals, including *AI & Society* and the *Journal of Cultural Analytics*, and as guest editor for the ongoing *Journal of Open Humanities Data* special collection on benchmarking in digital humanities.
