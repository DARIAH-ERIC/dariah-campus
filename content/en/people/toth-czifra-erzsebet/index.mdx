Erzsébet started her job as Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU in March 2018. She studied comparative literature studies, cultural studies and linguistics at the University of Szeged (Hungary) as well as at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. She received her PhD in Cultural Linguistics summa cum laude in 2018 at Eötvös Loránd University for her corpus study of the evolution of certain Hungarian word-formation schemata. After graduating, she taught linguistics and Hungarian as foreign language at the Eötvös Loránd University as well as at the Fachhochschule Burgenland in Eisenstadt, Austria. In 2016, her commitment to democracy in science led her to join ScienceOpen, a research evaluation and discovery platform, as Content Integration Manager and open science advocate. Her role at DARIAH enables her to merge the 2 main pillars of her professional life: humanities and open science. She is responsible for fostering and implementing open science practices across DARIAH and its cooperating partners and contributes to the design and implementation of open science policy statements, guidelines and service related to the open dissemination of research results in the humanities.
