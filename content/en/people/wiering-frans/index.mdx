**Frans Wiering** is an Associate Professor at the Music Information Computing group of the Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University (Netherlands).

He is the founder of the Thesaurus Musicarum Italicarum, a corpus of online music treatises by Gioseffo Zarlino and his contemporaries ([https://tmiweb.science.uu.nl/](https://tmiweb.science.uu.nl/)).
