    This workshop introduces participants to the background, and certain technologies and methods used for the spatial analysis of image datasets. The introduction provides a broad overview of the value of exploring the spatial properties of images while the rest of the workshop focuses on the methods of geotagging and spatial analysis through concrete examples and hands-on exercises.

    ##### Introduction to Spatial Image Analytics

    Photographs are inherently spatial artefacts. They are produced in specific spaces, and they usually capture and convey information about those spaces in a visual manner. The rapid developments in digital photography, GPS-enabled personal devices and geocoding techniques have enabled humanities and social science scholars to investigate the spatiotemporal properties of images alongside other forms of analysis. At the same time, such metadata can enable the exploration of big datasets, offer insights and opportunities to revisit our research practices, and generate new research questions.

    However, most image collections used in humanities research are not geotagged, and this limits the boundaries of exploring and understanding such collections. This workshop is an introduction to Spatial Image Analytics starting from an overview and the value of this approach, explaining the basic terms and concepts involved, and continuing with the methods and technologies used to perform spatial analysis of images.

    The following video introduces the basic concepts and the value of Spatial Image Analytics in the field of Cultural Heritage and the broader humanities. After watching the introductory video complete the exercise at the bottom of the page.

A new research project began when a scholar wished to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of production of such graphic material within the collection. While a significant number of files contained geographic metadata such as place and region names, very few had geolocation coordinates embedded in the actual files.

      Figure 1. The online record of a digital image collection. Europeana Collections website.\*

      *![Europeana website screen capture](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/b57b246b5c742f3fcbbc9cc1cf913acf6c4a3e0f-36179.PNG)*
      The above scenario highlights a common problem encountered by scholars who wish to explore the spatiotemporal aspects of a substantial digital archive image collection. Geographic metadata is a prerequisite for performing sophisticated spatial analysis of images, but in reality, very few humanities collections consist of files with such embedded metadata. Geotagging image files is a process that enables the geospatial exploration of such collections. In the following section, you will learn a manual approach to achieve this.

      To continue to the next section, you will need to have completed the Geotagging setup guidelines and launch Geosetter.

      *A heritage scholar has recently conducted a visitor survey as part of her research project focusing on understanding visitor movement and interactions in archaeological sites. Apart from systematic observations, interviews and the collection of other qualitative-quantitative data *through* questionnaires, she also employed tracking and recording technologies such as GPS tracking and camera recordings for obtaining location-based feedback. She will eventually analyse all visitor feedback by employing a mixed-method analysis, and for this, she will also need to prepare her image datasets for analysis. The first step is to use the obtained GPS data and geotag the hundreds of images captured by the study subjects.*
      In the above scenario, apart from the usual ethnomethodological approaches, the scholar employed Visitor Employed Photography (VEP) while she also collected geolocation data about each visitor's itinerary within an archaeological site. VEP has been commonly used in visitor studies for measuring visitor attention to exhibits or the natural environment (Camp *et al.* 2000). The GPS data are used in this case to geotag a large number of images which will be then analysed to reveal certain location-specific and theme-specific patterns of movement and linger behaviours. This geotagging approach uses the time metadata recorded both on GPS and image data to match the recording events. In this section, you will familiarise yourself with the process of collecting such data and the basic concepts involved in this geotagging approach which can apply to different studies.

      Collecting and preparing data for Geotagging\*\*
      Although giving a tutorial here on how to set up and operate a GPS device for data collection falls outside the scope of this workshop, it is important to understand the basic steps in the process of data collection. GPS data can be collected via any GPS handheld or wearable device.

      *Figure 5. GPS settings on a Garmin eTrex device.*![gps settings](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/3f23979a9bbe798342c8ffe120ae09abee3d41e5-36195.png)

      However, standard lightweight GPS devices, such as Garmin eTrex, have been reported as the most efficient tools for capturing geographic positions and movement in relatively small sized and entrance-exit controlled areas such as archaeological sites (Shoval and Isaacson 2010). GPS devices can be set up in two ways to aid image geotagging (see Fig. 5, left image):

      a) to record 'waypoints' (i.e. the GPS coordinates of a particular location) each time the user captures an image.

      b) to record a 'track' (i.e. a series of sequential GPS coordinates indicating the user's position each time during an itinerary) automatically based on a set time interval (e.g. every 2 seconds for high-density recording - see Fig. 5, lower right image).

      For the collection of image data, any digital camera should usually suffice. However, it is important to synchronise the camera's clock based on the accurate GPS time reading before starting data collection (see Fig. 5, left image).

      Tips on data gathering
      • Keeping notes all the time about anything
      • Give unique numbers to recording events, GPS devices/cameras if you are using more than one set
      • Note the date and time of each recording event each time it starts and finishes
      • Be consistent when coding and dealing with data
      • Need to synchronise your digital camera's clock to GPS time before taking photos
      • Ensure that the right date and year are displayed in the camera
      • Set your GPS to record track points on a frequent basis. The more track points you record, the better geotagging results you will obtain

      The GPS data is downloaded from the GPS device and saved in GPX XML format. GPX, or GPS Exchange Format, is an XML schema used to communicate information between GPS devices, software applications and online services and it describes waypoints, tracks, and routes. In this schema, location and other related data such as time and elevation are stored in tags (see Fig. 6). Based on the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84, latitude and longitude are expressed in decimal degrees and elevation in meters. The complete schema documentation can be found here.

      1.1.5 Batch Image Geotagging: Tutorial
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/12b902038ca89803ea6c70bebef45525875c34d5-36180.png)Once GPS and image data are collected (manual step) one can proceed with geotagging. In this section, you will continue to work with Geosetter and learn the batch geotagging process. Batch geotagging here means that a sequence of commands will be executed by the programme in one unit to match and embed the GPS coordinates in the recorded image files (automatic step). To continue in this section and follow through with the tutorial you are going to work with a set of images and a GPX XML file provided in the tutorial sources for Unit I. These datasets derive from a real study of collecting visitor movement and image recordings at the archaeological site of Gournia in Crete, Greece.

      Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded **Images\_copy** folder and select subfolder *V1*. Double-click on the first image *DSC05331* and then click on the tabs **Location** and **Source Description**\*\*\*.\*\*\* Notice that the description fields are empty. Go to the **Date tab** and notice the date and time metadata. The software is going to use this information to add geolocation metadata to the files.

      Select all image files. Then, go to **Images** tab and click on **Synchronise with GPS data files**. On the opened window, choose to **synchronise with data file** and navigate to the directory of the **GPS\_copy** folder and choose file *V1*. Now you will need to adjust the time on the images since GPS receivers capture the date and time in UTC format (nearly Greenwich Mean Time) and the sample images were created in a different Time Zone. Here you will need to add a time value. On the first drop down list choose \*\*Use Time Zone and on the second select the *Time Zone* of the location where the images were recorded. In this case, the images were captured in Greece, so choose (*UTC+02:00) Europe/Athens (plus DST +01:00 for all images).* After confirming your selection by clicking ok, a window should pop-up stating that ‘GPS data has been found for all ten images’ and asking permission to proceed with geotagging. On the menu bar click **Images > Save Changes** to save the geolocation information in the Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) header. EXIF data is a type of technical metadata that digital cameras and scanners produce to give information about the recording, such as shutter speed, aperture, camera orientation, GPS coordinates, image dimensions and other information.

      Notice that the map has automatically displayed and zoomed in the area of interest (Fig. 7, on the right part of the interface) and that the images are assigned with geolocation metadata (Fig. 7, the highlighted coordinates in red on the left part of the interface). Also, notice that when you click on one of the files on the left its geolocation is highlighted in the map area. Now click **Save** to embed the geolocation metadata in the files.

      You can continue practising this approach by repeating the process for image folders and GPS files V5 and V8 respectively. Then do the following exercise:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/0b4ccd4d5aa6a1904674faacd014c2c10ae8b446-36184.png)**Exercise:** A Recap on Image Geotagging. Answer the following questions

      As mentioned in the introduction video, adding and editing metadata to image files can be done via commercial, freeware and open source tools. Geosetter provides one of the best workflows for geotagging images, but it also allows users to add and edit administrative, descriptive, copyright as well as technical metadata.

      To learn how to geotag an image file in Geosetter, you are going to work with the digital image from one of Stackelberg’s works created during his travels in Greece between 1810-13 (Fig. 2). Navigate to the directory of the ***Images\_copy*** folder and select Stackelberg subfolder. The file should appear in the upper left window of the interface. Double-click on the first image entitled **The Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens** and then click on the tabs *Location* and *Source Description.* Notice that the fields are empty.

      **Figure 2. Black & white lithograph of the temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens from Stackelberg's "La Grèce. Vues Pitttoresques et Topographiques."** ![The temple of the Olympian Zeus in Athens](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/724c5f7e7e574791ee6380478be2567a24653eef-36176.jpg)
      To assign location information from the map to the image file, you will need first to find the location of the depicted place/monument. Login to Geonames web service and search for *Temple of Olympian Zeus Athens* and the service should return one record with five fields (see Fig. 3).

      *Figure 3. Returned search results from Geonames web service.* ![geonames screen capture](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/a6c555be2d4709f05d9d9436ac38a874391f8200-36188.PNG)
      Click on **S** symbol which represents a feature class to switch to map view. Copy the coordinates in the decimal format, return to Geosetter and fill in the field coordinates (in the map window) with the values in the appropriate format. Now the map should be focused on the area of interest. Click on Add/Edit. On the opened window click on the **Get from Web.** Notice the fields that have automatically updated. Now you can write the name of this location. Click ok and notice that a favourite place has been added to the map (see star symbol, Fig. 4). On the left, make sure that the image file you want to edit is selected, click on the star symbol on the map window and then choose **Assign position to selected images**. Notice to the left that the selected image has been assigned with location information (e.g. coordinates, area name and country). Now click save to embed information in the image file itself. Double-click the image and go to **Location** tab. Notice the added geolocation information.

    Image Geotagging Assignment
  </AssignTitle>

  <AssignIntro>
    **Optional assignment**

    Use a set of archival images to apply the manual geotagging approach you learnt in this unit. You can choose a set of images based on your background and previous experience, or something related to a topic you are studying in another module, or something that simply interests you. If you don't have a set of images available you can visit a humanities repository (e.g. Europeana Collections) and find a collection of images to work with.

### Geotagging setup

<Page id="268" moduleid="1179" visible="1">

    Geotagging setup
  </PageTitle>

  <PageIntro />

  <PageContent>
    In order to be able to complete Unit I you will need to:

    * download and setup Geosetter, a specialised freeware for editing image metadata and geotagging. Available at:

    [http://www.geosetter.de/en/download/](http://www.geosetter.de/en/download/)

    Geosetter has been developed for Windows Operating systems. To run Geosetter on an Apple Macintosh computer, the Mac must be set up to run Windows by following one of two installation options:

    *Option 1* : Create a dual-boot setup on your Mac. This allows you to boot into either Mac OS or Windows OS. The usual way to do this is to use the free software BootCamp. Available at: [http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/](http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/)

    *Option 2* : Create a virtual machine on your Mac. This allows you to run an installation of Windows OS in parallel with your existing Mac OS, and to seamlessly switch between the two. Typical choices for the virtualization option are the licensed software Parallels or VMware.

    * open a free account on Geonames geographical database

    [http://www.geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org)

    * download and unzip the folder 'tutorial\_resources \_1'

    **Geosetter setup**

    Run the executable file **geosetter.setup(.exe)** and follow the instructions in the wizard. Once the programme runs, firstly you will be prompted to configure the settings.

    Start from **File Options** tab\*\*.\*\* In the list shown to the left select the file type 'JPEG'. The parameters we define on the right side will apply only to this type of files. On the right, check the boxes as they appear in Fig 1. The chosen options will allow you both to store your metadata in a sidecar file as well as embed them in the file itself to avoid problems that occur when metadata are stored separately (see note 1 and 2).

    *Figure 1. File options setup.*
    ![Figure 1. File options set up ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/4c19d756f90c25bf0d18c9c0ac4a21b951a2d16f-36200.PNG)

    On the **Startup** tab select the directory of the image folder you are going to use for this exercise. Note that it is a good practice to use a copy of the files to avoid overwriting the originals. This step should look like Fig 2.

    *Figure 2. Directory selection*
    ![Figure 2. Directory selection](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/5f9a2c1e1ed415dfba445a42a3eba4e19dc2ba09-36202.PNG)

    On **Data Preferences** set the default time zone to (UTC+02:00) Europe/Athens. Make sure the box **Save GPS destination coordinates** is checked. On **Misc** set units of measurement to Metric and Format of coordinates to Decimal.

    Finally, go to **Internet** tab and change the URL address under Geonames to: [http://www.geonames.org/](http://www.geonames.org/)

    ***

    *note 1* Metadata is generally stored in two main places:
    Internally – embedded in the image file, in formats such as JPEG or TIFF.
    Externally – outside the image file in a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system or by a 'sidecar' file, such as the one supported by the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP).

    *note 2*
    Regarding metadata, it falls outside the scope of this workshop to familiarise students with basic concepts and terminology. However those who wish to delve into image metadata, I recommend reading the Guidelines For Handling Image Metadata by Metadata Working Group.

      2.1.1 What is Spatial Image Analytics?
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/af7b9dd9ef9e74c5c061ce9d0da17888e1468b90-36208.png)Image analysis refers to any process of obtaining meaningful information from images and image analytics refer to processes involving the application of digital techniques for the same purpose. Humans are very well equipped to extract meaning from individual images and perform sophisticated analysis of small datasets but not adept at processing a large number of records. Computation, on the other hand, can handle large amounts of data to identify new correlations and interpretations for various disciplines and applications.

      In this context, different techniques are continuously applied and developed to meet the requirements of cultural heritage as well as other arts and humanities disciplines. A substantial amount of work is focusing on data mining, remote sensing, and other image geospatial applications, on image processing for recording heritage and visual pattern or stylistic recognition, and influence in art and heritage collections. Other studies are more concerned with improving the spatial, temporal and visual classification of image datasets to enable searchability and further analyses.

      ![spatial image analysis\_Gournia](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/db735e7d4fa40be41daad5fcd3c199d32e1b2b11-36207.png) This workshop is concerned with the spatial properties of image collections and the methods that efficiently addressing questions about the 'where' of such humanities data. Such questions may wish to explore, for example, places of historical graphic material production and patterns of distribution, spatial patterns of cultural change as well as public perception and participation in understanding, safeguarding and disseminating cultural heritage artefacts and sites. This type of analysis uses directly geolocation metadata embedded in the image files rather than features within digital pictures (image processing).

      Then the term 'analytics' indicates that this type of image data inquiries is primarily quantitative. In essence, regardless of the particular software or programming approach employed each time, the analysis involves some spatial statistics applied to large scale image datasets. Today arts and humanities researchers and practitioners can use different software to perform this analysis also depending on the type of investigation and the visual output affordances. For instance, ImagePlot, a free software developed by the Software Studies Initiative for Humanities research, affords to plot, visualise and discover different patterns in image collections and other media by exploring either image properties or file metadata.

      In the following section, you are going to learn how to perform a particular type of analysis which explores spatial patterns of incident data. The 'incidents,' in this case, will be the locations of images recorded by visitors in the second scenario of Unit I (see section Batch Image Geotagging).

      2.1.2 Introduction to Hotspot Analysis
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/af7b9dd9ef9e74c5c061ce9d0da17888e1468b90-36208.png)A significant step towards making better sense of the collected image data in our working scenario is the HotSpot (HS) Analysis. This analysis is carried out in ArcMap, the desktop application of ESRI suite, with the aggregated and integrated points of image locations captured by the visitors. For this analysis, ModelBuilder, a toolbox in ArcMap that acts as a visual programming language for building geoprocessing workflows is used to create a conceptual model of the analysis. For instance, a typical workflow may include some geoprocessing tools such as *Copy Features*, *Integrate*, *Collect Events* and *Hot Spot Analysis*.

      The methodological procedure of conducting HS analysis is well documented in ArcGIS but it is useful to explain some basic concepts of the method in this section. One of the crucial decisions for implementing such an analysis is to select a conceptualisation of spatial relationships (*inverse distance*, *travel time*, *fixed distance*, *K nearest neighbors*, and *contiguity*) based on the questions you are asking and the data you are using. Let's explain this with the use of an example. An Art History scholar is interested in identifying the most significant locations (hotspots) of foreign travellers' graphic depictions of monuments and landscapes during the 19th century in Greece. Her substantial and well-documented dataset consists of geotagged digital images converted into geolocation point features. Once she obtains the hotspots, she will be able to focus her research on specific areas and eventually use other methods to understand and interpret any spatial patterns she observed through the analysis. She is not aware of an average distance between the depicted locations (point features) and she is unsure about whether monument proximity actually influenced artists to work with specific clusters of monuments. So in terms of choosing the right conceptualisation of spatial relationships for conducting the analysis, using the *fixed distance* approach with a distance band that is large enough to ensure all features will have at least one neighbor seems appropriate.

      A simple hotspot analysis (Hotspot Analysis with Rendering) can be a very useful spatial statistical approach for cases where you have good knowledge of the geographic extent that spatial phenomena take place and you require a simple method to spatially classify image datasets. The heritage scenario discussed in *Unit I* offers a good example. In this research study, the dataset consists of 1656 geotagged images recorded by visitors at the archaeological site of Gournia, a Minoan urban settlement. For this type of study, you will usually have a good knowledge of the case and site-specific parameters (e.g. the geolocation accuracy, the dense urban character and relatively small size of the site and the visitor-space interaction approach), and better control over the scale of the investigation. The assumption is that certain locations attract visitors' attention more than others not only because of a single attraction (e.g. an impressive feature of the site) but because of a combination of features and site attributes in around a small area. Then each image (feature) is processed within the context of neighboring features based on a designated distance. This way, images that were captured outside the distance of the target feature each time do not influence calculations.

      ![Gournia\_HS analysis](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/78dcdc392cebac94fbc0992cc80ede5acfaed240-36209.jpg)

      The final output is a cluster analysis visualisation indicating the hotspots or points of interest (statistically significant locations). The clusters here represent classified areas depending on how many images were recorded by visitors the most at certain locations and provide a useful exploration of the visitor-space interaction. This particular analysis generated 58 unique locations, the hotspots, which represent weighted clusters of image data. The resulted clusters were classified and visualised with a colour ramp. Based on the latter, warm colours indicate higher values of weighted clusters and cold indicate lower values. As you can see in the image, the red dots indicate areas where visitors captured the most images while the blue dots indicate areas with the least image recordings. The exact value of each generated HS is found in the ICOUNT field, which is the resultant count attribute indicating the number of events/image points contained in each HS. It is also worth mentioning that in order to complete the interpretation of the data, other qualitative image analyses complemented the HS analysis such as the thematic classification of images for each hotspot.

      To continue to the next section, you will need to have completed the Spatial analysis setup guidelines and launch ArcMap.

      2.1.3 Hotspot analysis for image data: tutorial
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      **Adding a Map** \*Figure 1. Adding map from ArcGIS Online.\*Launch ArcMap. Before preparing for the actual analysis we first need to add a background map (basemap) in our ArcMap workspace. By default, when you launch ArcMap, you will be prompted to choose between opening a new map or creating one from a template. Choose to create one and select *blank map*. Now you will need to select an open source map from ArcGIS Online. Go to **File** and click **ArcGIS online** and proceed to sign in. For this tutorial, you need to add a basemap from Greece. On the search box type for maps and data by using the term ‘Greece’. You can choose any map you prefer, but it is recommended that you choose a detailed topographic map (e.g. such as the one produced by the Community Maps Programme, see Fig. 1).![basemap spatial analysis tutorial](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/e7411e975e10b7b2ac4d859afcb80e82dff27d29-36212.PNG)

      *Figure 2. Image data points and Identify window in ArcMap.*![identifier](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/9ba055fc0f23e81fd6618b47bf4bc3fbff180da7-36214.PNG)**Data Management**
      On the right of the ArcMap interface, open the **Catalog** menu. Here you will find all sets of tools (toolboxes) required for setting up and running the analysis. First, you will have to convert your geotagged image data to points. Under **Data Management Tools.tbx**, go to **Photos>Geotagged Photos To Points**. In the **Input Folder** field, navigate to the directory where you have saved your geotagged images from Unit I and select the respective folder. To do this, you will need first to establish a folder connection so that ArcMap knows each time where you keep your data. Click on the folder icon, select **Connect To Folder,** navigate to the folder and **Add** it to your connected folders. Both input and output fields are filled in automatically. You can choose to specify the location where the analysis will save the invalid photos table and **Add Photos As Attachments**. Both these options are preferred for providing better control over the analysis results at the interpretation stage. Select ok and notice the new layer with the image data created on the left, under **Table of Contents** and the points of data overlayed on the map area. You can explore and edit the properties of this new layer by right clicking the layer and selecting **Properties**. On the **Source** tab, notice the Geographic Coordinate System and Datum information. The performed Data Management approach uses by default the same coordinate system with the input data (GCS\_WGS\_1984, D\_WGS\_1984). Also, you can change the **Symbology** properties to enhance the visual output of the data. Return to the toolbar section, select **Identify** and hover the cursor over the image points. Click one of the points and in the opened window notice the available metadata (e.g. *Location, Name, Date* and *Path*). From **Path**, you can access and view the raster image file which has been attached to the respective image point.

      **HotSpot Analysis with Rendering** Once the data are ready for analysis you will proceed with building the conceptual model for the analysis. On the toolbar, go to **Geoprocessing** and select **ModelBuilder**. Begin creating the model by dragging the image layer from the ArcMap Table of Contents into the model. Next add the **Copy Features** geoprocessing tool to your model (drag from ArcToolbox). The Copy Features tool is located in **Data Management Tools>Features toolset**. **Connect** the Calls object to the Copy Features tool which will order a copy of the feature class because we are going to use tools that will change the geometry of the original input feature class. You can rename the Copy Features output to *Collected\_Photos*. To do this, double‐click on the Copy Features tool and change the Output Feature Class.

      *Figure 3. The conceptual model at the Integrate stage.*![modelbuilder1](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/014281a2373c1dedfa35cccc5e2c3c169e06e936-36215.PNG)Add the **Integrate** tool to the model (drag from ArcToolbox). The Integrate tool is located in **Data Management Tools>Feature Class toolset**. This function will aggregate image points that are within a given distance range or XY or on top of each other and will create an attribute value associated with each feature which will be used as the Hotspot analysis Input field. The Integrate tool allows moving all image points that occur within a specified distance into a single location where they can be counted using the **Collect Events** tool. Use the Connect Tool to connect Collected\_Photos to Integrate. Then double click the Integrate tool and enter 6m for the XY tolerance parameters. This distance means that any image taken within a radius of 6 meters of another will be considered by Integrate process. Rename the Integrate Feature Output to Integrate Output (right click>rename). So far, your model should look like the model in Figure 3.

      Add the **Collect Events** tool located in **Spatial Statistics Tools>Utilities toolset**. The Collect Events tool will create a new feature class with a count field indicating the number of coincident image points at each location. The Integrate and Collect Events tools use the same input file, but since the first step of the point aggregation process is the Integrate tool, the Collect Events tool must not run until after the Integrate tool is finished making points within a radius of 6m. To set this parameter, right‐click on the Collect Events tool and select **Properties**. Under the **Preconditions tab,** set **Integrate Output** as a precondition. Rename the Collect Events output to **WeightedPhotos** by double‐clicking on the Collect Events tool and changing the Output Weighted Point Feature Class. Double-click on the Results and notice that a count field is created which will indicate the number of images aggregated in one location based on the analysis parameters.
      Add the **Hot Spot Analysis (Getis Ord GI\*)** tool to your model by dragging from **Spatial Statistics Tools>Mapping Clusters**. Double‐click the tool and specify all the following parameters:

      *Figure 4: The final conceptual model of Hotspot Analysis.*- Input Feature Class: Weighted\_Photos

      * Input Field: ICOUNT
      * Output Feature class: ConceptualisedHotSpotResult
      * Conceptualization of Spatial Relationships: Zone of Indifference
      * Distance Method: Manhattan
      * Distance Band/Threshold Distance: 6

      ![modelbuilder schema final](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/spatial-image-analytics/cdb9de2718f51356f046ea7eadff70a22098b951-36216.PNG)

      Right-click on HotSpot Results and select **Add To Display**. This will ensure that when the model is run the results layer will be added to the map display. The final model should look like Figure 4. Run the model and go to the map area to see the displayed results and play around with the visualisation options. Right-click the generated hotspot layer and go to **Properties**. Choose **Symbology>Graduated symbols** and set parameters as shown in Figure 5. You can also choose the **Graduated Colours** option. Go back to map and explore the results of the Hotspot analysis.

    Spatial Image Analysis Assignment
  </AssignTitle>

  <AssignIntro>
    **Optional Assignment** Choose a set of geotagged images based on your background and previous experience, or something related to a topic you are studying in another module, or something that simply interests you. If you have completed Unit I, use the dataset that derived from Image Geotagging Assignment. Perform a hotspot analysis on your dataset.

    Then write a short essay of approximately 1000 words addressing the following questions:
    a) Describe your dataset. How does the spatial analysis improve your understanding of the data?
    b) What kind of new questions will this analysis be able to answer? Why is this important in your study area?

    Use images from your collection and an instance of the produced map overlayed with the analysis results to present your essay.

    **Software Download**

    In order to be able to follow through and complete this unit's practical you are required to create an ArcGIS account and download ArcMap as specified below:

    * Open an ArcGIS account and subscribe for a 60-day trial of the software which includes access to the following: ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS for Desktop, ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, additional ready-to-use apps.

    Available at: [https://www.arcgis.com/features/free-trial.html](https://www.arcgis.com/features/free-trial.html)

    * Download, Install and Authorise ArcMap with extensions. Once you have created the account, you will receive an e-mail with detailed steps and the authorisation code for ArcMap. This is the main tool you will be using throughout this unit.

    ArcGIS for Desktop has been developed for Windows Operating systems. To run ArcGIS 10.x on an Apple Macintosh computer, the Mac must be set up to run Windows by following one of two installation options:

    Option 1: Create a dual-boot setup on your Mac. This allows you to boot into either Mac OS or Windows OS. The usual way to do this is to use the free software BootCamp.

    Using BootCamp: [http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/](http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/)

    Option 2: Create a virtual machine on your Mac. This allows you to run an installation of Windows OS in parallel with your existing Mac OS, and to seamlessly switch between the two. Typical choices for the virtualization option are the licensed software Parallels or VMware.

    ESRI has more information on these options here. When configuring Windows with any of these options, pay attention to the minimum system requirements for installing ArcGIS.

    **Data resources download**

    Make sure you have concluded Unit I and that you have geotagged all the files of *tutorial resources,* folders *V1-V8.* Rename the image files in a way that each set of images reflect the ID of their creator \[e.g. files in V1 were created by visitor #1, so they could be renamed as V(1), V(2),....V(n)]. Then extract all renamed geotagged images from their individual folders and create a single folder to use for the spatial image analysis tutorial.
