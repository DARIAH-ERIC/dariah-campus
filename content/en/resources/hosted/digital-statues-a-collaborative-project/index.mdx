summary:
  content: In this presentation we learn about how 3D scanning of a sculpture
    museum dedicated to a single Icelandic artist has been used to engage
    schoolchildren under the umbrella "art for everyone". It also explores other
    projects with making digital twins for cultural heritage purposes and the
    role of the private sector in this endeavor.

Digital statues (stafrænar styttur) is a collaborative project between the Einar Jónsson museum and EFLA Consulting engineers in Iceland. It received support from “Barnamenningarsjóður” (children's culture fund) and “List fyrir alla” (art for everyone). The purpose of the project is to bring the Einar Jónsson museum to schoolchildren in a digital form, regardless of their location. This was done by creating exact digital twins of a large number of Einar's works using photogrammetry and other scanning techniques. The museum has also prepared studyguides that teachers can use free of charge.

Developed within the INTERREG NPA funded project DACCHE: [https://linktr.ee/dacche\_interreg](https://linktr.ee/dacche_interreg)

Event hosted by the Centre for Digital Humanities and Arts ([https://www.mshl.is](https://www.mshl.is)) and the Gunnar Gunnarsson Institute ([https://www.skriduklaustur.is/is/gunnarsstofnun](https://www.skriduklaustur.is/is/gunnarsstofnun)).

## Learning Outcomes

After studying the resource, learners should be able to:

* understand the value of collaboration between private companies and public institutes for cultural heritage projects;
* learn about the use of photogrammetry and 3D scanning;
* be acquainted with the production and use of digital twins of natural and cultural landscapes.
