    Using the reader survey R package LitRiddle, this resource offers a gentle
    introduction to tabular data analysis in Rstudio. Following along the code
    examples, students will learn about Rstudio, Markdown files, and how to
    explore, analyse and transform quantitative data in R.

## Introduction

This tutorial introduces the basic steps of quantitative data analysis in the programming language R. We will also introduce Rstudio, a free programme (IDE) in which you can create and run R scripts. The dataset we will explore comes from the Dutch National Readers' Survey, in which readers' judgements on 401 novels were captured. This dataset is wrapped in an R package called [LitRiddle](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/litRiddle/versions/1.0.0).

To make the most of this tutorial, I encourage you to first download R and Rstudio, and then open this file (rmd) \{add link} in Rstudio. That way, you can try out the code for yourself, do the exercises and modify the code when you take the next step of applying your new knowledge to your own data.

## Learning outcomes

After working through this course, students:

* can find their way around the base functionalities of Rstudio, including the pane layout.
* Are able to create R markdown files, understand their components, and export them.
* Can perform the basic steps of quantitative data analysis in Rstudio, making use of the Tidyverse syntax. By adjusting the code supplied, they can work on their own materials. They can import datasets, inspect their data, create a basic plot, select information, add new columns to a table, and group and summarise their data.
* Are familiar with the LitRiddle dataset, which contains Dutch readers' assessments of the (literary) quality of 400 popular Dutch and international novels.

## Tools and resources

You can download and install R and Rstudio (in that order!) from:

[https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

You can download the tutorial file from: xxx  and open it with Rstudio. The text is identical to this webpage. You can also read through the steps below, but the code samples are not executable.&#x20;

## Getting started with Rstudio & R markdown

### R Markdown files

Many different types of files can be created in Rstudio, even *gasp* Python files. The handy filetype we will work with is .Rmd, an R Markdown file. Markdown files combine text and code, allowing you to integrate the code output, such as a graph or a table, with your report. The advantage here is that others can see both your analyses and the computational steps you took to create your output. Markdown files can be exported into various formats (pdf, Word, html), for easy sharing with others. Before exporting, you can also customize which parts of the document to show or keep hidden.

Let's check out some functions of a Markdown file. When you have this file open in Rstudio, you will notice at the left top the options 'Source' and 'Visual' mode. The source mode reveals the code used for text layout. The visual mode is easier to use for now.&#x20;

Then, at the right-hand side of the document, you see a menu item called 'Outline'- it is handy to keep that one active, to better navigate the file.

Under the 'Knit' menu, you will find the export options.&#x20;

You can add code blocks through the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-I or through the green square with the C.&#x20;

In this tutorial, you will find several exercises, where you are asked to adjust and write your own code. Correct answers to these exercises are to be found near the end of this document. (There are many ways to correctly solve the exercises though.)

## The Riddle project - exploring literary quality

It is time to run our first code. In the code block below, you see lines with # in front of them as well as black text. The # 'comments' a line; basically treating it like text instead of code. You can easily comment and uncomment lines through placement of the hashtags. In the .rmd file, you can run a code block through pressing the green 'play' button on the top right, or through placing your cursor somewhere in the block and pressing Ctrl-Enter. The output of your code will show up directly underneath the code block.&#x20;

```R
{r installing the packages}

# these top two lines only need to be run once, you can put a # in front of the line to 
# deactivate the code 
 # install.packages('litRiddle')
# install.packages("tidyverse")

# here the packages are loaded into your workspace. These lines need to be run every time you're
# working with these packages.

library(litRiddle)
library(tidyverse)

```

Now we have access to the dataset of the [Riddle of Literary Quality](https://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nl/) project. This project investigated the question of literariness by examining both readerly assessments of general quality and literary quality, as well as textual characteristics, for a corpus of 401 books: both original Dutch and translated works, in several genres of fiction (romance, suspense, literary fiction and other). 13.541 respondents have shared their opinions. Together, they provided 448.055 book reviews. Allthough, due to copyright concerns, the full texts of the novels are not available, the dataset does include word frequencies for the 5000 most frequent words, for each book, unlocking stylometric analyses for this corpus.&#x20;

## The litRiddle package

You can read about the data of the Riddle-package by running the code block below. The introduction to the package will then open to your right side, in the 'Help' tab. Here you can find out about the three combinable tables of reader survey data, as well as some helpful code snippets to get you started with exploring this dataset. You are free to use this dataset for your own research, but please include a reference to the package. The vignette includes citation information.&#x20;

```R
 {r accessing the readme of litriddle }
vignette('litRiddle')
```

## The wonderful world of Tidyverse

The other package that is loaded is called 'Tidyverse'. It can help with all steps of data analysis, from loading and cleaning your data to visualising it in graphs and charts. If you would like to learn more about tidyverse, and the data philosophy behind it, this is the manual:

[https://r4ds.hadley.nz/](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

'Base' R can do lots of the things the Tidyverse can do too, but the Tidyverse functions are more intuitive and user-friendly.

Usually, the first step would be loading your data in the working directory, so that Rstudio can access it. Now, as we will work with the data from the litRiddle package, we can do this through the code below - it works a bit differently when you have your own tables to work with. The second step would be inspection and cleaning - as this data is already in mint condition, we will also skip the cleaning. So let's check out the data!
