    Using the reader survey R package LitRiddle, this resource offers a gentle
    introduction to tabular data analysis in Rstudio. Following along the code
    examples, students will learn about Rstudio, Markdown files, and how to
    explore, analyse and transform quantitative data in R.

## Introduction

This tutorial introduces the basic steps of quantitative data analysis in the programming language R. We will also introduce Rstudio, a free programme (IDE) in which you can create and run R scripts. The dataset we will explore comes from the Dutch National Readers' Survey, in which readers' judgements on 401 novels were captured. This dataset is wrapped in an R package called [LitRiddle](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/litRiddle/versions/1.0.0 "package documentation").

To make the most of this tutorial, I encourage you to first download R and Rstudio, and then open this file (rmd) \{add link} in Rstudio. That way, you can try out the code for yourself, do the exercises and modify the code when you take the next step of applying your new knowledge to your own data.

## Learning outcomes

After working through this course, students:

* can find their way around the base functionalities of Rstudio, including the pane layout.
* Are able to create R markdown files, understand their components, and export them.
* Can perform the basic steps of quantitative data analysis in Rstudio, making use of the Tidyverse syntax. By adjusting the code supplied, they can work on their own materials. They can import datasets, inspect their data, create a basic plot, select information, add new columns to a table, and group and summarise their data.
* Are familiar with the LitRiddle dataset, which contains Dutch readers' assessments of the (literary) quality of 400 popular Dutch and international novels.
