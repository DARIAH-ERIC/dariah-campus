    This introduction to the Social Justice in the Digital Humanities curriculum
    from DARIAH TEACH gives an outline of the overall curriculum, the authors of
    the curriculum, and how it is uniquely formed to be a 'living' curriculum,
    with individual modules being added periodically.  This course will 'never
    be finished', reflecting the perpetual and continual work that is required
    in social justice.
