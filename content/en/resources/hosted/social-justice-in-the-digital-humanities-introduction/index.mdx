## The Genesis of This Course

This course was envisioned and developed under the aegis of two working groups of DARIAH (The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities): #dariahTeach and Ethics and Legality in the Digital Arts and Humanities. It was funded by a DARIAH Working Group grant.

This course is a testament to the socially-engaged and politically-aware digital scholarship happening around the world led by researchers and within heritage institutions. It is edited and managed by Susan Schreibman, and co-edited by Koraljka Kuzman Šlogar, Marianne Ping Huang, and Walter Scholger. Research assistants are Felix Bui, Sina Krottmaier, Ella van Geuns, and Anna Villarica.

Envisioned as a community-driven course, the majority of case studies have been authored by those who envisioned, developed, and manage the amazing projects working at the intersections of social justice and the digital. A number of case studies have been developed by those working on the Social Justice and the Digital Humanities course.

This course will never be complete. We acknowledge our biases in reaching out to prospective case study authors, and we very much welcome new case studies. If you have a project that you would like to feature in this course, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) and one of our team will respond as soon as possible.

## Instructions

This page provides basic instructions for navigating through the course. Courses include a diversity of learning material divided into different sections consisting of content in different forms, including text, multimedia, presentations, interactive exercises, and quizzes. Below you can find a brief description of the learning units and content types in IGNITE.

Courses are divided into Units. Each course has four to five units, each covering a different topic area within the theme of the course.\

You can navigate through the units by using the navigation bar on the left. The green arrow next to the unit lets you expand the unit content. Each unit consists of lessons and lessons consist of pages; interactive content, case studies, scenarios, and exercises.

Units are divided into lessons. Each unit has one to four lessons, each covering a different topic area within the theme of the unit. Lessons are presented in the order you are expected to go through them so as to get a cohesive understanding of the theme.

These may include textual narratives, embedded multimedia, interactive content, quizzes, and PowerPoint presentations with voice-over.

Each lesson in IGNITE includes content in different forms. Text is always accompanied by relevant media, either produced by the IGNITE team or sourced by third parties. Interactive exercises, quizzes, explanatory videos with voice-over and step by step tutorials are used to provide a solid grounding in methods and theories. Case studies and scenarios that meld theory and practice are also used to enable learners to to delve into various real-world situations, and position the skills and knowledge acquired into different contexts.

These may include textual narratives and embedded multimedia, interactive content, quizzes, and PowerPoint presentations with voice-over.

Interactive elements may range from image sliders and flip cards to hot spots and timelines and require some form of interaction to go through their content.

A case study includes more information than a scenario and is used as a starting point for learners' to delve into particular theories and/or methods and think how their principles could be adapted for similar case studies.

By taking into account a problem, its context, and possibly accompanying data will need to make a decision and/or solve the problem. Although scenarios can be authentic, i.e. based on a real situation, they are usually based on fictional (but realistic data) to to simplify the complexities of real-world cases but at the same time to build on real-life issues.

These are designed for lone learners or groups and are typically part of a lesson. They take the form of quizzes or other types of interactive content.

## Intended Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course one should

* understand the ways in which researchers and heritage institutions have embedded social justice concerns and practices into their research and exhibition design
* through the exercises associated with case studies, analyse corpora, organisations, or data from a social justice perspective
* evaluate the myriad of ways that social justice can be embedded in digital scholarship
* be aware of both the factual and conceptual underpinnings for the social justice research, historical background, and continuing injustices highlighted in case studies
* have more self-knowledge of one's own positionality in relation to social justice, locally, historically, nationally, and regionally

## Teaching and Learning Methods

This Course consists of a variety of learning modalities that gathers case studies on the topic, broadly conceived, of social justice and the digital humanities. Each of the three case study units are introduced theoretically and are followed by a number of case studies. The fourth unit is a toolbox in which we have gathered a number of tools and protocols to assist those who would like to embed social justice conceptually and practically into their digital research or exhibition design.

The course consists of text, videos, and interactive elements, and extensive further reading. Some case studies provide exercises which can be done individually or as part of a class. No additional software is needed to take this course. It is delivered asynchronously, with no beginning and end date. As such, it is always available.
