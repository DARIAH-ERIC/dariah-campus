## Introduction to the course

This workshop introduces participants to the background, and certain technologies and methods used for the spatial analysis of image datasets. The introduction provides a broad overview of the value of exploring the spatial properties of images while the rest of the workshop focuses on the methods of geotagging and spatial analysis through concrete examples and hands-on exercises.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

## Introduction to Spatial Image Analytics

Photographs are inherently spatial artefacts. They are produced in specific spaces, and they usually capture and convey information about those spaces in a visual manner. The rapid developments in digital photography, GPS-enabled personal devices and geocoding techniques have enabled humanities and social science scholars to investigate the spatiotemporal properties of images alongside other forms of analysis. At the same time, such metadata can enable the exploration of big datasets, offer insights and opportunities to revisit our research practices, and generate new research questions.

However, most image collections used in humanities research are not geotagged, and this limits the boundaries of exploring and understanding such collections. This workshop is an introduction to Spatial Image Analytics starting from an overview and the value of this approach, explaining the basic terms and concepts involved, and continuing with the methods and technologies used to perform spatial analysis of images.

The following video introduces the basic concepts and the value of Spatial Image Analytics in the field of Cultural Heritage and the broader humanities. After watching the introductory video complete the exercise at the bottom of the page.
