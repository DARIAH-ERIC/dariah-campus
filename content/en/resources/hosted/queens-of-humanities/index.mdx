How do we tell the story of humanities as the essence of understanding humankind in all its
aspects and bring it back to the table as an equal partner of science? Seeking an answer to this
question, this webinar presents the scope and dissemination of the Queens of Humanities campaign
run last year by OPERAS-PL. Its purpose was to promote innovative humanistic approaches and
show their relevance in today's world.

"Born digital" monographs, data visualisations, web applications, podcasts or vlogs were
presented as innovative outputs aimed at telling the story of humanities as an indispensable and
ubiquitous means of expanding human knowledge about the world. The posts were also an
occasion to bring up important problems of humanities research, such as the underestimation of
innovative publications that do not fit with the strict academic criteria.

The "Queens of Humanities" project is a simple, yet inspiring advocacy project which can be
implemented among different audiences and through various social channels. It also reflects on
Facebook, which, despite increasing competition in the area of social media, offers
unsophisticated, yet sufficient solutions for storytelling targeted at specific local audiences.
