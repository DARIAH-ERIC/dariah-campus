This resource offers an introduction to the ARTEMIS project by its scientific coordinator, Franco Niccolucci. The video resource illustrates the main concepts of ARTEMIS: the Heritage Digital Twin (HDT) and its concept, the ARTEMIS ontology, the project Knowledge Base (KB) and how to integrate data in the KB by aggregating external repositories. In addition, the Reactive Heritage Digital Twin (RHDT) is introduced and how it can serve the professional conservation, restoration and research in cultural heritage community. Its potential is in simulating reactive data and how the pilots that the project creates, illustrate this potential. Finally the talk explains the use of AI, and suggests possible research collaborations.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, learners will be able to:

* explain what a heritage digital twin is.
* describe goals and objectives of the ARTEMIS project and the full digital approach.
* understand how professionals in conservation, restoration and researchers in heritage science can benefit from digital twin technology.
* explain what the ARTEMIS digital commons is.
* describe how LLMs and AI are used in ARTEMIS.
