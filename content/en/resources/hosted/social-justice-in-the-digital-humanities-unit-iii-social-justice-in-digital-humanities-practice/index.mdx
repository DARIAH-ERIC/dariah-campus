‘Intersectionality' (race, gender, class) can as shown in Unit I be seen as entanglements of inequity, which can not be approached in siloed ways. Sex and gender issues typically cannot be understood without considering race and class, and race and class cannot be understood unless we acknowledge that our practices, unfolding through knowledge technologies and systems, also imply knowledge paradigms vested in long histories of coloniality, the structures of which continue to prevail. Thus, we must approach such entanglements of knowledge inequality much the same way that we approach other complex problems, e.g. anthropocene entanglements. Of the latter Donna Haraway has famously advised to ‘stay with the trouble’ and do knowledge work through ‘string figures’ (Haraway, 2016; Museum Fatigue, 2020).

We know string figure games as the children’s game of ‘cat’s cradle’, played with a loop of string or yarn in rounds of pattern making – from one pair of hands to the next. String figure games are found all over the world and the technique is the same, but the patterns differ and the way Haraway reference string figures as patterns we weave together, in so many ways covers what we are practicing in this course – in order to stay with the trouble of social justice in knowledge production – by adding in ideas, theories, stories, practices from projects and places across the world in a continuous weaving, recognizing that we can no longer claim linear or privileged pathways to universal knowledge. When speaking of na’atl’o’, the Navajo string games, Haraway writes:

> These string figures are thinking as well as making practices, pedagogical practices and cosmological performances. Some Navajo thinkers describe string games as one kind of patterning for for restoring hózhó, a term imperfectly translated into English as “harmony”, “beauty”, “order”, and “right relations to the world,.” It matters which ideas we think other ideas with \[my italics] my thinking or making cat’s cradle with na’atl’o’ is not an innocent universal gesture, but a risky proposition in relentless historical contingency. And these contingencies include abundant histories of conquest, resistance, recuperation, and resurgence. (Haraway 2016, 14-15)

Our knowledge institutions, knowledge systems and the way we manage them are more often than not considered universal and objective. However, from the perspective of the history of science, our knowledge institutions, knowledge systems and technologies as well as the practices put in place for knowledge production reveal entanglements of embedded coloniality, racialisation, gender inequality and class distinction which pervade the discourse of universalism and the structures of ‘objectivism’. Intersectional issues and entanglements are structural and lie deep in our institutions and our systems and practices, and unless we become aware we will, unconsciously, reproduce historical biases through inherited and biased knowledge systems and technologies in the claim of universal knowledge. So, to start thinking with others as proposed in the image of string figures, we need to consider and disrupt this idea of universal and objective knowledge – and its foundation in a particular paradigm of knowledge, which gained hegemony over hundreds of years of colonialism, suppressing other knowledge systems, as part of colonization of territories and peoples.

###### 1.Coloniality, Local histories, Ecologies of Knowledge

The definition of science and the knowledge paradigm we know and practice within European/Western Culture began in the 15th Century and has often been attributed to the European Renaissance and the revival of classics – philosophy, poetry, poetics, and mathematics – much of which came to us through translation of Greek manuscripts, retrieved from Arabian libraries. But, our knowledge paradigm is also unthinkable without the European colonizing powers going towards the East, the West and the South, creating a sourcing network of knowledge items structured around power, and consequently developing knowledge institutions such as universities and academies, libraries, museums and archives as a result of colonial exploitation and trade. ‘Data’, documents, and artifacts gradually accumulated at these Western centers of knowledge, building over time an institutional framework which made it easier to accumulate more.

> \[...] during the period 1500 to 2000, one local history, that of Western civilization, built itself as the point of arrival and owner of human history. Ownership was expressed by building a system of knowledge as if it were the guardian of all knowledges, past and present \[...] (Mignolo 2012, x)

Western epistemic, economic, political and cultural hegemony was possible because the construction and management of knowledge was in the hands and heads of European actors, in European languages and supported by European institutions. ‘Westerncentrism of knowledge’ means that sustainable knowledge was cast in six modern European imperial languages based on Greek and Latin. This is not a geographical but an epistemic concept. (Mignolo 2013, 10)

Walter Mignolo, author of Local Histories/Global Designs (2000/2012), The Politics of Decolonial Investigations (2021) and co-author with Catherine E. Walsh of On Decoloniality. Concepts, Analytics, Praxis (2018) has vastly theorized the concept of decoloniality as an ontological and epistemological concept. This concept, which gradually over the past few decades, has encouraged us to more broadly think of knowledge and knowledge systems as not being universal, but rooted in local histories and epistemes, countering a colonial history that over a period of more than 500 years hegemonized the many knowledges of those living in coloniality, in the image of Western civilization. Mignolo argues that coloniality is the dark side of modernity, and that Western epistemic hegemony of the spheres of culture, knowledge, aesthetics, and sensibility – caused not only other (kinds of) knowledge to be muted, but also was instrumental in the disappearance of local knowledge (epistemicide) – that has been a significant driver of Western political and economic expansion.

What Mignolo understands as ‘Global Designs’ are a direct result of Western civilizations and coloniality suppressing local histories and causing epistemicide. This has been undertaken and “disguised with the rhetoric of modernity, of salvation and progress.” (Mignolo 2012, xvi) . As a remedy Mignolo proposes ‘border thinking’ which is thinking and doing knowledge while staying in the border. Epistemic borders open in moments when the imaginary of modernity - in the spheres of culture, knowledge, aesthetics – cracks to reveal its Janus-faced darker side of coloniality. Such moments of border thinking allow us to acknowledge a plethora of local perspectives within the same border, “not only what is visible in the ‘ground’, but what has been hidden from view in the ‘underground’ by successive layers mapping people and territories” (Mignolo 2012, 24). Border thinking is an actional epistemic approach, it may be multidisciplinary but is seldom solely academic, as it goes beyond or is delinked from disciplinary territorialities, aiming at “doing decoloniality” and changing structurally the perimeters of knowledge.

Border thinking with local histories takes other tools than what we find within Western knowledge institutions. It is a structural disruption of the paradigm which went from Western knowledge centers to the East, South, and to the Americas in a dispersal of the institutional paradigms which became one of the backbones of coloniality. For intersectional communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, information retrieval through existing knowledge systems is often an experience of being made invisible reinforcing the experiences of such communities as being undervalued as legitimate sources of knowledge, and ones that cannot provide unique insights into interconnecting systems of social and colonial injustice. This is where colonialism and hundreds of years of knowledge extraction and epistemicide by colonizing powers have turned into coloniality as a legacy of long-standing patterns of power that still define sociocultural and economic structures and relations, as well as knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations.

> Coloniality survives colonialism. It is maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic performance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image of peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects of our modern experience. In a way, as modern subjects we breathe coloniality all the time and every day (Maldonado-Torres 2007, 243)

While the struggles for decolonization characterized many of the 20th Centuries social justice movements claiming equality, decolonial thinkers take these struggles towards the liberation from coloniality as power structures of knowledge, identity, and being – including institutions such as universities.

Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni, author of Epistemic Freedom in Africa (2018), has prominently theorized the conceptual and actual power structures and border zones between the epistemologies of colonialism, coloniality, and practices of decoloniality in academia and beyond:

> As an epistemological movement, it has always been overshadowed by hegemonic Euro-North American-centric intellectual thought and social theories. As a political movement, it has consistently been subjected to surveillance of global imperial designs and colonial matrices of power. But today, decoloniality is remerging at a time when the erstwhile hegemonic Euro-North American-centric modernity and its dominant epistemology are experiencing an epistemological break. This epistemic break highlights how Euro-North American-centric modernity has created modern problems of which it has no modern solutions and how theories/knowledges generated from a Euro-North American-centric context have become exhausted if not obstacles to the understanding of contemporary human issues. (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2015, 485)

In 2022, Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni contributed to a series of twelve video-interviews on Decolonial Thinking, in the ninth interview, on Ecologies of Knowledge, African Archive, Ndlovu-Gatsheni states amongst other that decolonizing 'means that we change the archive, from which we draw, and that also means that we recover that which has been displaced. We need to remember what has been dismembered \[...] Therefore we need to look for other knowledges to rescue ourselves from the epistemic crises we find ourselves in. \[...] One knowledge system from one civilization is no longer adequate.' (4:13)

<Embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzXfNm-i38U?si=NOp-bONpX4kxFrvM" />

In the interview above, Ndlovu-Gatsheni also talks of the emergence of “ecologies of knowledge”,\
that recovering local knowledges which have displaced, means putting them towards remedying\
the epistemic crisis brought on by the institutional hegemony of Western-centric knowledge.

According to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Western-centric knowledge

> is no longer adequate to the problems the world is facing therefore we need to look for other knowledges so that we rescue ourselves from the systemic and epistemic crisis we are in. So it is in this context, you draw from Islamic knowledge, you draw from African knowledge, you draw from Indian knowledge, you draw from indigenous peoples knowledge. \[...] It means that the problems facing humanity are so sophisticated that one knowledge system from one civilisation is no longer adequate. (4:58)

###### 2. Changing the Archive: Who Studies, Whom Is Studied

Unit III is our contribution to highlight how interventions into specific aspects of existing knowledge systems and technologies can reveal less linear, but more ‘complete’ epistemic systems and production which are similar in practice to string figuring across knowledges and border thinking, opening ecologies of knowledge towards the systemic entanglements of coloniality and intersectionality. In this way, historians of the history of science, such as Donna Haraway may speak about disrupting ‘violent hierarchies’, particularly about who has the opportunity to study and whom is studied.

Let us start with the question of how embodied knowledge of exclusion or tokenization is a significant and situated knowledge, pointing to the sensitivity towards lived experience as a knowledge form (Mignolo) when approaching structural exclusion from knowledge spaces. This question is about what counts as knowledge, as well as acknowledging situated points of view within the idea of rational knowledge and that the object of knowledge can turn into a subject of knowledge. In her seminal essay, “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House,” (Sister Outsider, 1984) intersectional feminist and poet activist Audre Lorde, asked, “What does it mean when tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of the same patriarchy?”. And then she answers: “It means that only the most narrow perimeters of change are possible and allowable.” Lorde wrote her essay after having been invited as a speaker to an academic conference in 1979, only to find herself the token Black Feminist and Lesbian Artist in a diversity panel. Issues of tokenism mistaken for representation, as experienced in the public spaces of knowledge production, is where intersectional inequality is ‘felt’ in an embodied way. Frantz Fanon wrote about this in Black Skin, White Masks (1952) in which Fanon analyzes and relates the lived experiences of being Black. Fanon’s phenomenological approach is adopted by Sara Ahmed in “The phenomenology of whiteness” (2007) in which she takes such experiences into an analysis of institutional spaces:

> After all, institutions provide collective or public spaces. When we describe institutions as ‘being’ white (institutional whiteness), we are pointing to how institutional spaces are shaped by the proximity of some bodies and not others: white bodies gather, and cohere to form the edges of such spaces. When I walk into university meetings that is just what I encounter. Sometimes I get used to it. \[...] Whiteness is only invisible for those who inhabit it, or those who get so used to its inhabitance that they learn not to see it, even when they are not it. (Ahmed 2007, 157).

Another point made by Sara Ahmed, in On Being Included (2012) is that meager representation is still an issue in knowledge institutions and even if these institutions have equipped themselves with diversity officers and committees, ‘commitment to diversity’ remains symbolic or ‘non-performative’, as the institutional commitments do not bring about what they name. On Being Included is based on Ahmed’s interviews with diversity workers and practitioners in higher education institutions and on her own work as a diversity officer. One conclusion to be drawn from Ahmed’s empirical work in On Being Included is that diversity counts as an institutional value proposition, but that representation is not how inequality and exclusion are solved structurally. Much the same point for another seminal branch of knowledge capacity building, the field of library and information studies (LIS) in the US, has been put forward by Sofia Y. Leung and Jorge R. López-McKnight, editors of Knowledge Justice. Disrupting Library and Information Studies through Critical Race Theory (2021):

> Like most other fields, library and information studies (LIS) has framed the race problem as one of diverse representation of racialized bodies, rather than one of racial power, domination, and privilege. \[...] This understanding lacks a critical understanding of racial power and how it operates in the field, which is unsurprisingly considered how radical justice efforts centered on race have materialized in the US society. (Leung and López-McKnight 2021, 2)

In her 1988 book, Situated Knowledges, Donna Haraway offers a critique of the existing science paradigm introducing the notion of ‘situated knowledges’, which is also embodied knowledge, to replace scientific objectivism. This seminal text was part of Haraway’s feminist (and activist) critique of Reaganist politics and the exclusion of intersectional and embodied experiences as pathways to knowledge:

> I am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, positioning, and situating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims. These are claims on people's lives. I am arguing for the view from a body, always a complex, contradictory, structuring, and structured body, versus the view from above, from nowhere, from simplicity. Only the god trick is forbidden. (Haraway 1988, 589)

Haraway argues that claims for universal knowledge and disembodied objectivity is the hyper-bias of western knowledge systems which she finds schrouded in metaphors of abstract vision – also described as knowledge from “the point of view of the unmarked \[...] the master, the Man, the One God (Haraway 1988, 587). In the place of the ‘god trick’ of indifferent objectivism, Haraway argues for a clearly positioned and responsible knowledge production where what has counted as ‘objects’ for science, may become actors of situated insights. Haraway in no way discards rational science, rather, she calls for a new rationale by pointing to scientific abstraction and disembodiment - one might add ‘disengagement’ or indifference - to this hyper-bias, which has guided the West for hundreds of years with the consequence of excluding the partial, the embodied, the limited or muted voices, the powerless: what we may recognise as the communities being robbed of the knowledge which entered science as objects, as artifacts, becoming collections and specimens to be studied:

> We seek not the knowledges ruled by phallogocentrism (nostalgia for the presence of the one true Word) and disembodied vision. We seek those ruled by partial sight and limited voice – not partiality for its own sake but, rather, for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated knowledges make possible. Situated knowledges are about communities, not about isolated individuals. The only way to find a larger vision is to be somewhere in particular. (Haraway 1988, 590)

Knowledge institutions create and sustain knowledge systems. This is also true with our technical knowledge infrastructures, our digital and software interactions with resources, as well as with fellow knowledge seekers and creators of these systems. Digital information systems provide library and archival services, virtual knowledge environments and labs, digital infrastructures. As it goes for analogue spaces, we also experience virtual or digital spaces as excluding certain bodies and knowledges and as such un-consciously biasing research, education and social innovation when moving further into a digital transition.

Social Justice principles applied to knowledge systems such as archives, libraries, databases, and infrastructures go beyond issues of representation and towards critical interactions and interventions. The epistemicide of colonized and excluded cultures and the hierarchies of who studies and whom is studied, are embedded in knowledge institutions throughout the West – from the physical institution in terms of how objects and collections have been displayed, cataloged, and described, to new digital infrastructures in terms of the metadata standards utilized to the search systems providing access. In his 2006-article “Introducing critical race theory to archival discourse”, Anthony W. Dunbar suggests a number of ‘disrupting’ approaches when introducing Critical Race Theory to unearth biases in archives, from researching counter-stories to official documentation and searching for micro-aggressions across the system of appraisal of archival records. Dunbar is looking for “ the sensibility and consciousness \[...] to explain cultural contexts beyond traditional institutional perspectives'' and to acknowledge \[...] that institutional memory is a negotiated space with multiple points of interpretation” (Dunbar 2006, 117).

> \[...] the records continuum model suggests that when a record is created, it establishes at least two identities, that of the documenter (or records creator) and the documented (the subject of the record). At this point, it should be clear that both the documenter and the documented have different perspectives or vantage points of the ‘‘transaction’’ that a record is documenting. As a result it is also possible that the differing perspectives can constitute a development of different realities. In some cases, there may be differing if not conflicting documentation because those who are documented can have institutionally-created or self-created records of the same transactions that the documenter has recorded. (Dunbar 2006, 124)

To Dunbar, the aim of introducing critical race theory to archival discourse (and consequently, archival practices) is one of democratizing archives from a structural point of view, in providing “an opportunity to discuss records multi-dimensionally as products, such as recordkeeping vehicles and artifacts of evidence, as well as processes, namely transactions and identity development” (Dunbar 2006,124). This approach is based on the assumption that records can be made to provide multiple dimensions, if the aforementioned power structure of ‘who studies’ and ‘whom is studied’ is recognized as an imbalance between the records creator and the subject of the record which can be disrupted.

Unit III will, as the other units in our Social Justice in the Digital Humanities course, offer a number of case studies highlighting new knowledge practices, going beyond or disrupting a Western knowledge paradigm, as well as its history of gathering ‘objects’ for study and for building the institutions themselves around stored artifacts, specimens, and data.

Humanities scholarship has been moving into a more interdisciplinary and hybrid direction. Collaborations between researchers in different fields, and the combination of traditional methods of engaging with or preserving data with new digital methods, can result in new insights. Here we look at the case of Walking the Archive of District Six, a joint project between the University of Cape Town and University of Michigan. Through this case, we illustrate how interdisciplinary research, new technologies and methods can play a role in education and in surfacing individual and community memories that were subjected to forced removal, in turn becoming a tool to advance social justice in the humanities.

##### District Six

District Six was a densely populated working-class area in Cape Town’s inner-city. It initially developed slowly during the time of colonial (Dutch and British) occupation, and following the abolition of slavery in the 1830’s, there was a growing need for urban housing. A multiracial and multicultural community developed over a period of time, and was spurred on by massive immigration and economic growth. District Six, with its close links to both the port and business district, was an obvious place of development, and later, inner-city decay. In contrast to the growing racialisation of the rest of the country, District Six developed into a community that was cosmopolitan and respected diversity. In one sense, it was a living example of the ‘rainbow nation’ that post-apartheid South Africans would romantically wish for themselves (Soudien, 2021).

In the 1940’s the Cape Town city council planned to demolish buildings in District Six under slum clearance, but it was only during the Apartheid era that this happened. Following the rise to power of the racist Afrikaner National Party in 1948, the policy of Apartheid was introduced. Apartheid was an ideology that institutionalised racial segregation by means of laws, such as the Population Registration Act, 1950.

By this law, people were classified and registered according to their racial group. Overall, the white minority subjugated people of colour, enforcing nearly half a century of brutal racial oppression. By means of the Group Areas Act, District Six was declared a Whites-only area in 1966, and the demolitions began in 1968. This marked the beginning of the forced removal of approximately 60,000 Black individuals from District Six between 1968 and 1983. Families’ homes and businesses were demolished by the state’s bulldozers, and by the mid 1980’s, District Six was mostly vacant land. Today, District Six still has vast swathes of vacant land, but some people are slowly being returned by means of a process of restitution.

##### An interdisciplinary project: District Six archives, memories, geographic data

In the project ‘Walking the Archive of District Six: Memory, Augmented Reality and Counter-Surveying’, scholars David A. Wallace and Siddique Motala combine their expertise in archives and geomatics to help recover these memories and promote social justice.

Dr David A. Wallace is a clinical associate professor based at the School of Information at the University of Michigan. His work focuses on how archives shape or misshape our construction of the past and present, accountability in recordkeeping, archival social justice, freedom of information and more, with projects spanning the US, South Africa and Rwanda. Dr Siddique Motala is a senior lecturer based in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Cape Town. His interests lie in the fields of geomatics, historical mapping, digital storytelling in education, with a special interest in decolonization efforts. He is known for his work on mapping the site of District Six and his collaborations with the District Six Museum, filmmakers and other scholars. Presenting at the 2022 Global DH Symposium, the authors summarized their project:

> *“We wanted to virtually reconstruct District Six in terms of the lost built environment and stories of still-living ex-residents and their experiences before, during, and after demolition” (Wallace & Motala, 2022)*

*Interview with Dr David A. Wallace and Dr Siddique Motalla about the making of the project.*

Since 2018, they have been collaborating to bring to light the memories of people forced out of District Six. They started by combing through baptismal records from St Mark’s Anglican church, one of the few historical District Six structures still standing. They also worked with former District Six residents who provided oral accounts and personal records. Information extracted from these sources, combined with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) mapping helped researchers identify the precise locations of addresses on the present-day landscape. These were plotted on a GIS map, virtually reconstructing the demolished environment.

Furthermore, in 2019, this joint project identified key landmarks through oral histories of survivors and records from the District Six Museum. These landmarks, which included schools, social centres, places of worship and cinemas, were likewise plotted on the GIS map. This would later become an online interactive experience on the District Six Museum website: the interactive map on the St Mark’s Memory Mapping Project.

##### New methods and new technologies

Motala has also developed a walking-as-research (Motala and Bozalek, 2022) methodology called “counter-surveying.” This involves using GIS data to determine and mark locations of demolished homes and establishments, as well as walking with people connected to the sites. In the Global DH conference, Motala remarks on the need for decolonizing education, stating that he developed Counter-Surveying in an attempt to “conscientise CPUT students to the socio-political-historical aspects of the site that their university was situated on” (Wallace & Motala, 2022, para. 13). This method helps recover the stories of people who used to live there and applies geomatics in “new ways that challenge the silencing and erasure of Black people” (Wallace & Motala, 2022, para. 13).

In addition, Motala has been taking groups on walking tours of District Six. The tours include analog maps and photos that visitors can use to compare the current environment to what it used to be. Motala and Wallace believe that such walking tours of District Six can be made better through the use of technology. Since 2022, they have been working on a walking tour app that incorporates augmented reality technologies to guide users on walks of District Six. Through this app, visitors will be led to the exact locations of demolished homes and establishments. They will be shown what used to exist there through digitized and born-digital still images, audio, and videos. Visitors can be simultaneously immersed in the present and the past.

##### Conclusion

Interdisciplinary projects such as ‘Walking the Archive of District Six’ are important in advancing decolonial practices. In this case, they relate to social justice in engineering, archival science, and education. The project aims to recover the memories of the District Six community in Cape Town by using primary sources in tandem with emerging digital technologies and counter-surveying to shed light on former residents’ experiences before, during and after the removals. In drawing attention to the stories of District Six, the project brings forth issues of racism, forced displacement, neo-colonial planning practices and the continued contestations around social memory, history, and land ownership. Overall, this project works to challenge the silencing and erasure of black lives during and after the Apartheid regime. The work of Wallace and Motala could be applied to similar contexts of forced removal, reclaimed and debated memory and continued justice seeking.

### 3.3 Slavery: The Rijksmuseum’s Ten True Stories Physically and Digitally Told

###### This case study is written by Anna Villarica and is based on the Rijksmuseum: Slavery exhibit in 2021 curated by Eveline Sint Nicolaas, Valika Smeulders, Maria Holtrop and Stephanie Archangel. The page is designed by Felix Bui.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/16e0284e75847421828f59f0aaa3c556165e4234-71332.jpg)*In the case of this painting, archival research revealed that the girl’s name was ‘Isabella’ and that she posed for painter Simon Maris when she was twelve. The label was changed accordingly.*

##### 1. Introduction

In room 1.18 in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam hangs the portrait of a young girl holding a fan. The label reads: *Isabella, Simon Maris, c. 1906.*\
Until a few years ago, this painting was called *Young Negro-Girl*, with the model described as ‘East Indian’ or ‘Little Negress’. In 2015, the Rijksmuseum combed through the digitized labels of 220,000 artworks for racist words used by Europeans such as ‘negro’, ‘dwarf’, ‘Mohammedan’ and more. Racially charged language was removed and the descriptions improved. It was the first museum in Europe to do so (Siegal, 2015).

Soon after, the Rijksmuseum would embark on an exhibition on slavery which opened in 2021\[1].Four years in the making, *Slavery: Ten True Stories* was the first major exhibition about slavery for the Dutch National Museum. It was also the first time that stories of slavery across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were to be told in one exhibition in the Netherlands. While the onsite exhibit at the Rijksmuseum lasted for a few weeks, the richly illustrated digital stories of Slavery and related media can be experienced on the Rijksmuseum website.

###### 1.1 The legacy of slavery

Enduring social issues such as racism and discrimination in the Netherlands have been attributed to slavery. In the past, ‘black people were enslaved by white people because they were Black’, says historical novelist Cynthia McLeod from Suriname, in an interview for the book companion of the Rijksmuseum Slavery exhibit (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2021, 303). Europeans who took part in slavery, she explains, ascribed Black people animal features, describing them as having low intelligence and no emotions in order to justify their activities. Race theories from the 18th and 19thcenturies also claimed that race is arranged on a vertical line with the white race on top, providing justification on white people’s domination and abuses of Africans and Asians. McLeod concludes, ‘This is racism. Slavery has been abolished, but that thinking still exists’ (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2021, 304)

There is also increasing awareness of how the prosperity the Dutch enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, came at a cost. The wealth made during the Dutch Golden Age came in part from slavery and the exploitation of indigenous people and their land. As part of the transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th centuries, the Dutch shipped more than 600,000 slaves from West Africa to Europe and the Americas. Moreover, profits from sugar and spices powered by slave labour in Dutch colonies, created wealth for the Dutch. Enslaved people who resisted their captors were tortured and killed. Although slavery was abolished in the Netherlands in 1644, it remained legal in the colonies until 1863.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/rijks-legacy-of-slavery-627" />

Looking into the legacy of this history has become more urgent. Since the Black Lives Matter movement was (re-)ignited in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the USA, similar protests calling attention to racism have spread to the Netherlands. There have been incidents of colonial statues in the country being defaced.

Repeated criticisms have come from the public for practices deemed racist. These include outcries on the royal family’s use of the Golden Carriage that contains racist imagery, and the painting of blackface by people playing Zwarte Piet on St Niklaas Day. Official apologies for the country’s role in slavery came in 2022 and 2023, first from the Prime Minister Mark Ruitte, and then from the King of the Netherlands, His Majesty King Willem-Alexander.

###### 1.2 Response

More is being done beyond issuing official apologies. The Dutch government and institutions are re-examining Dutch history and the legacy of slavery. In the case of the Rijksmuseum, they recognised that the history of slavery has not yet been studied by the museum in depth nor is it reflected in how their collection is presented. This is despite slavery being a part of national history, ‘a living past for many people beyond its walls’ (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2020, 9). There is also an understanding that more work needs to be done to create a more holistic account of history. Colonial archives, records left by the wealthy and literate, tend to reduce the enslaved to numbers, describe them in denigrating terms and take away their humanity. The enslaved are included in the archives in bills of sale, interrogation transcripts, and records of complaints and punishments. These records reflect the perspective of the colonial rulers.

##### 2. *Slavery: Ten True Stories* at the Rijksmuseum

As a way to create a counter-narrative, from 2017 to 2021, the Rijksmuseum worked on *Slavery*, an exhibit that offered an unflinching look at how slavery is intertwined with Dutch history, as well as the museum’s own collection. The approach for *Slavery* was to tell the history of slavery not through abstract concepts such as numbers and dates; instead, the exhibition focused on the personal stories of ten people whose lives were touched by slavery. These people suffered from slavery, fought against it, or were people who profited from it. These ten individuals came from the Netherlands, as well as Brazil, Suriname, the Caribbean, South Africa and Asia, from countries that had been under Dutch colonial rule.

Some were items never before displayed, including plantation tools and objects cherished by enslaved people. An audio guide was created to accompany the exhibit, and for this, a deliberate choice was made to privilege narrators who were connected in some way to the 10 featured individuals through geography, familial relations, who were descendants of the enslaved people, or have worked to bring their stories to light.

For instance, the story of Wally, an enslaved person who worked on a plantation in Suriname, is narrated by Surinamese-Dutch athlete Remy Bonjasky. Remy’s ancestors worked on the same plantation as Wally. Meanwhile, the story of Lohkay, an enslaved woman from Sint Maarten is narrated by musician-educator Anastacia Larmonie. Born in Curacao but raised by parents from Sint Maarten, Anastacia grew up listening to Lohkay’s stories and now creates music about her and other warriors like her. While experiencing the physical exhibition, visitors could also listen to these narratives, as well as oral sources, songs and chants. Through the embedded aurality, visitors could be brought closer to the emotions and experiences of enslaved people as the vast majority were not permitted to write, and hence record their experience. Below are some of the pieces featured in the exhibit.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/rijks-people-behind-the-audio-narratives-628" />

Two years after the exhibition closed in The Netherlands, in February 2023, the exhibition was featured at the United Nations Headquarters in New York as a capsule collection. At the time of writing (July 2023), it is at the UN Office in Geneva as a poster presentation. *Slavery: Ten True Stories* endures as an online exhibition on the Rijksmuseum website.

##### 3. The digital afterlife of *Slavery: Ten True Stories*

While the physical *Slavery* exhibition at the Rijksmuseum was available for public viewing for two months, it has a lasting online presence \[2]. The opening of the physical exhibit was accompanied by the release of the online exhibition *Slavery* - online resources that became especially important in engaging the public, as *Slavery’s* opening coincided with closures of public venues in the Netherlands. Far from being an inventory of digitised artefacts from the physical exhibit, Slavery online features four areas to explore: richly-illustrated multimedia stories on the ten individuals (‘The 10 people’), Animations, a video feature on the La Bouche du Roi installation, and a recording of the symposium on Sources on Slavery.

###### 3.1 Multimodal storytelling

*The 10 People* multimedia stories first take the visitor on a mini virtual tour. Each starts with a 3D view of the museum space dedicated to the person, as a voiceover briefly introduces the gallery and the historical context. The camera pans around this space, introducing the pieces within, the layout and the museum design. If the video is paused, the visitor is able to change their viewpoint by clicking and dragging their cursor, or use the zoom functions +/- on the right to examine the pieces or the museum environment more closely. After this 3D mini tour, the narrator is introduced; they explain their connection to the person and begin to tell their story.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/45ec8c6ef68cf47c20b18bed012fc87c313b7efe-71336.png)*3D experience: 'The story of Surapati'\
Click on the play button to explore.*\
The narration, the same as those on the accompanying audio guide for the physical visit, layers on top of visuals such as drawings and photos of the objects, paintings, or archival documents.

If the video is paused, the visitor can likewise zoom in and out of the photos, or drag them to the sides with their cursors, enabling them to see more details. Apart from the voiceover and visual elements, music and chants also feature in the storytelling. (For some individuals, there are cartoon video animations in the Animations section of the online exhibit

###### 3.2 Online symposium on inclusive sources and interdisciplinary collaboration

Drawing from a variety of sources was important to prevent reproducing the power dynamic found in historical records and to tell stories from the perspective of the enslaved. This topic was the focus of the international online symposium *Sources on Slavery and Slave Trade* organized by the Rijksmuseum, the National Archives of the Netherlands and the National Library of the Netherlands. The symposium was held on April 23, 2021 (before the exhibit opening), but it is available for replay on the *Slavery* exhibition website and has become part of its enduring online presence. In the symposium, researchers and professionals reflected on the importance of inclusive use of sources for museums, archives and libraries. Explore the slider below to see some of these sources discussed in the symposium, the ones that contributed to the *Slavery* exhibit.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/rijks-beyond-written-records-629" />

*Various sources/ data points beyond written records are included in the exhibition. Click on the hotspots to learn more.*\
In the symposium, the experts on the panel also discussed issues around making sensitive data about slavery more accessible through digitisation and open access. Dutch historian Karwan Fatah-Black from Leiden University noted that the abundance of digital sources make it possible to ‘ask more questions, to ask different questions, and try out new methods in the way we do this history’ (1h.48m.30s). Digitisation also makes it possible ‘to connect these different archives and to make more complete and fuller stories…that have been hidden by history before’ (1h.49m.00s). Meanwhile, Dutch historian from Radboud University Coen van Galen, discussed how having open, easily accessible digital sources (such as digitised slave registers) was a ‘great way to democratise the study of slavery’ (1h.54m.30s). He further highlighted the public impact of these easily accessible digital sources, for example by providing inspiration for plays people talk about, reaching ‘even those strands of the population who never would do anything with slavery’ (1h.55m.00s). Bondan Kanuyomoso, Lecturer and Researcher at the University of Indonesia, noted how open digital archives can give students direct access to primary sources, when previous interactions with the past could have been through history books (3h.19m.50s). Online access was especially important during the pandemic, when people were not able to access archives in person.

Keynote speaker Marisa Fuentes, a historian at Rutgers University, warned that although ‘digitalisation makes access to these archives broader and more inclusive…the abundance of archives doesn’t disappear the ways in which enslaved people are represented’ (32m30s). She also noted how if there are paywalls, the ones who gain may be those from the countries that profited from slavery. Access to digital archives does not erase the power constructed within them, so Fuentes encourages approaching them critically. Archival studies lecturer Stanley Griffin from the University of West Indies also discussed the limits of digital archives, noting that while memory is ‘resurrected’ by technology, ‘still, we cannot hear them’ (2h.04m.00s). He reminds the audience how for marginalised people, ‘a drum, a song, a movement…they are a means of creating information, of sharing information, of passing down information’ (2h.08m.40s). Digitised archives based on written outputs and records reflect the perspectives of the colonial masters who wrote them and do not fully capture cultural expressions. Griffin ends by playing a video where a slave chant is recorded and combined with visuals of the plantation, noting that this is ‘another form of digitisation’ (2h.13m.30s) that bring the focus on the people and not on the records, which was what the Rijksmuseum was striving for.

###### 3.3 *Look at Me Now*: Engaging the public to reflect on slavery

It is clear that much effort and collaboration from professionals from different disciplines was necessary to stage the exhibition. But apart from experts, the museum also invited the public to engage in telling the story of slavery. After experiencing the *Slavery* exhibit (online or onsite), visitors were encouraged to participate in the creation of the Look at Me Now sculptures. LAMN consisted of ten sculptures on the Rijksmuseum premises, one for each person featured in *Slavery*. From May to August 2021, artists David Bade and Tirzo Martha from Curacao built the sculptures based on contributions from the public.

A form of public humanities, LAMN asked citizens to reflect on the ten stories and consider: *Who made the greatest impression on you? How would you like to tell their story?* For each story, there was also a prompt that related the story of that individual to the visitor in the present day (see Figure 9 for examples). The public could submit ideas for their chosen sculpture via email or send a handmade piece to the museum. David and Tirzo worked on the sculptures everyday based on these contributions. The progress of each sculpture can be viewed on the Rijksmuseum website as well.

##### 4. Other efforts in re-examining the museum collection

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/766926d7f3a4df556d68e07fdf951a90a0f88d2b-71132.gif)The museum also embarked on the *Rijksmuseum and Slavery* initiative alongside the temporary exhibition *Slavery*. Works in the Rijksmuseum were initially meant to glorify the history of the Netherlands, and through this initiative, they have been re-examined to reveal previously unknown links to oppression and slavery. Additional labels were then added to paintings and objects in the museum to explain a previously hidden connection. While the labels from the Rijksmuseum and Slavery initiative were on from February 2022 to February 2023, these are available for download from the Rijksmuseum website. Moving forward, the museum endeavours to continue to evaluate their labels, noting that ‘wherever possible, the new information will be integrated into our museum in order to do greater justice to the Netherlands’ complicated history.’ (Rijksmuseum and Slavery n.d., paragraph).

The museum has also created a guided tour to highlight the museum collection’s complex entanglements with Slavery. Those visiting in person can follow the route in the Colonial Past tour, available through the Rijksmuseum App. This takes them through 20 pieces connected to trade, exploitation and slavery during Dutch colonial history. This includes the Night Watch, arguably the most famous painting in the Netherlands.(For those wishing to view the additional labels from the Rijksmuseum and Slavery project, the Rijksmuseum app also provides a guided tour for these 77 works and the added information.) Extra layers of information from the app can enrich the in-person museum experience. Beyond the audio narration, text and pictures, the app makes use of music (e.g. the opening audio is a Surinamese song about slavery and violence) and explanatory videos with additional information.

##### 5. Conclusion

*Slavery: Ten True Stories* is an example of an exhibition that was designed to be both a physical and a digital exhibition, with the digital elements an integral part of the exhibition strategy. The exhibition evinced a duty of care to the many anonymous individuals connected to items in the collection: portraits in which the enslaved are not named, items created by enslaved artisans whose names were not recorded, or only recorded by their first names, as well as the many individuals whose identities were submerged into new ones in written in ledgers and journals as they progressed from free individuals to the enslaved.

The digital afterlife of the exhibition records and preserves these stories for a wider public audience, making it a model for curating an exhibition in multiple modalities.

***Footnotes:***\
\[1] The exhibition was staged at the Rijksmuseum from 5 June to 29 August (Yang, 2022). It was planned for May 18 to August 29, 2021, but due to the pandemic, the Rijksmuseum was closed to the public from December 2020 to June 4, 2021.

\[2] The basis for the online version was the audio tour that every visitor to the physical exhibition received. To underline the importance of oral sources, the museum chose to give all visitors a device with the audio tour for free.

In 2016, the College of Humanities of the University of the Philippines in Diliman burnt to the ground in a fire that wiped out the Pablo K. Botor Library, containing hundreds of theses and unique copies of books. This was not an isolated event: between 2013 and 2018, four buildings of the University of the Philippines and the National Historical Archives of The Philippines burnt down. It was precisely the issue of document preservation that led a group from the University of the Philippines in Diliman and a team from the University of Antwerp to collaborate together on a project, PhilPeriodicals, that had two objectives: firstly, the preservation of documents, especially newspapers because of their vulnerability and their importance for the study of artistic production, history, and Philippine society. And secondly, improving the accessibility of these documents, not only from outside the Philippines, but from within the Philippines, as even for Filipino scholars the distances, time, and money needed to travel to consult them could be prohibitive.

The research team of the University of Antwerp belongs to the research group ACDC and includes Mike Kestemont, Dirk Van Hulle and myself among others, while the interdisciplinary team from the University of the Philippines was spearheaded initially by Sir Anril P. Tiatco and afterwards by Ramon Guillermo, joined by Anna Sarmiento and Chito Angeles, the head librarian of the University of the Philippines. Together, we applied for a TEAM project from the Flemish Agency for Academic Cooperation (VLIRUOS) and were successful in obtaining a four-year grant for €249,922 with the goal of preserving these unique documents, strengthening collaboration between our teams, as well as provide training in digital skills to professors in order to analyze and utilise these documents. Another no less important goal was to train the library team in methods to make these documents publicly available.

##### Rationale

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/6ab88e2a02c585f02e8e941af820bdd666171c63-71344.jpeg)*Important figures from Philippine culture\
featured in the newspapers, such as\
Rosa Sevilla de Alvero, an advocate for\
female suffrage and the founder of the first\
Catholic school for women* *in the Philippines.*

Departing from these goals, we were able to define three main objectives: (1) the digitization of newspapers and creation of a repository, which joined other digitization projects already undertaken in the country such as at the University of Santo Tomás Digital Library, funded by Unibank, or the Filipinas Heritage Library Online carried out by Ayala Foundation (for more information on digitizing projects in the Philippines, see Ortuño Casanova and Sarmiento 2021). The project also facilitated the purchase of equipment, and trained library staff, as well as undertook the transcription of the materials; (2) the organisation of training courses in digital humanities for academic staff to exploit the digitised materials for distant reading; and (3) the organisation of an exhibition to bring these materials to the public.

The significance of our project lay in the importance of the documents for understanding and valuing Philippine history, especially at a time when anti-Ferdinand Marcos documents were being censored and the history of the period was being rewritten with alternative discourses. Therefore, the project not only encouraged a return to historical sources, but provided the means to undertake quantitative analysis of them. This was especially important to provide an antidote to the many historical hoaxes and fake news circulating in the media, in books and in society. Additionally, the digitised documents were important for researchers and audiences outside the Philippines: the use of first-hand materials can highlight the Eurocentric and hierarchical discourses used in colonial times and, by reflecting on them, help to avoid such biases in present-day research and societal discourse. The availability of such an archive is key to discussions of decolonisation in the Global North, as well as to counter resurrected narratives such as that going on in Spain in which the nineteenth-century idea of the benefits of colonisation, civilisation, and mestizaje is being repeated. In bringing all these documents into the public domain, we considered ways in which they could reach both, academics who could produce new knowledge from them, as well as the community, by asking such questions as:

> What could the digitisation of Philippine documents contribute to the knowledge of Philippine history by locals and outsiders alike?
>
> How could it help the re-appropriation of their own history, which was sometimes written in languages that are not widely known to the public and researchers?

One of the added values of digitisation, apart from bringing the materials in disparate locations together, was the possibility of automatic translation of the materials: the Philippines is a country with more than 130 official local languages, while much of the historical press is written in Spanish, English, and Tagalog. Although English and Tagalog are still spoken in most parts of the country today, the Spanish language died out in the Twentieth century, and therefore these newspapers, which are of great historical and literary interest, tend to be less consulted. Once digitised and transcribed, they can be translated, for at least an approximate understanding, thus returning them to importance in historical discourse as well as Filipino identity. Below are three samples of newspaper scans depicting minority groups in the Philippines, one from each historical period. Click on the dots in the embedded slider below, to see the scans from the Spanish, American and Independence periods:

##### Challenges

Working on such a project in the Philippines created certain challenges. Philippine internet connection is one of the slowest in the world. This hindered our attempts in using Transkribus (an automatic transcription tool to create machine readable text). It also created problems with the repository, as high-resolution images took a long time to load for users, thus necessitating alternative ways of displaying newspaper images. Moreover, the project was set back by two other factors. The first was the COVID-19 pandemic, and the second was the imposition of European logic over the interests and needs as seen by Filipino teachers, scholars, and librarians.

The advent of COVID-19 meant that the planned physical exhibition was not able to take place, but it was launched in digital format which can be viewed on PhilPeriodicals (You can see the slider below for an impression). It offers a journey through various themes in Philippine history (literature, wars and revolutions, women and journalism, minorities in the Philippines, and the representation of Japan) with the newspaper as the primary source of knowledge. Each of these themes has its own sub-exhibition with several sections. These sections develop narratives that weave together examples taken from Philippine newspapers and magazines in various languages and underscore the importance of incorporating into the our writing and understanding of history the varied perspectives of the population, represented here by the languages in which they wrote and read. In addition, the exhibition incorporates digitised materials from other Philippine, American, or Spanish collections, not only from the repository created through this project. In this way it is possible to add important context while making links to other similar projects. In the physical version of the exhibition, which is planned to take place at the Ayala Museum in Makati, Metro Manila, we will provide a mechanism for the public to leave comments on the objects or to search for and incorporate others. We will also have computers in the exhibition room with instructions on how to search for villages or surnames in the newspaper repository. These activities can connect the public with their families' past through newspapers.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/philperiodicals-interface-632" />

The second setback was less outward facing. Although the project was supported by the staff of the University of the Philippines who contributed ideas to the process, the needs analysis and action plan were drawn up by researchers from Antwerp, from where the money was also managed. Thus, we found that the library staff had different ideas about the priorities for use in a digital library: they prioritised the indexing of single articles over OCR. From our point of view, indexing a selection of articles was of little use: there was not an established criteria for the selection of which articles to index individually, and the indexers were doing their work without understanding the language of some of the periodicals that they were working with. We proposed instead the possibility of a word search of texts among other implementations that we, in the coordination, had wished for but did not get. The different visions for the use of the texts might have been anticipated.

On the one hand, there was a disciplinary breach. We intended to reach an agreement between users of the repository (e.g., the researchers) and librarians. However, I think that we as users were requesting features and giving examples that were far from the expertise of people working in the library. Coming to an agreement was compounded by the pandemic and the impossibility of traveling leading to difficulties in communication. Another factor may have been due to tensions in the ownership of the project as well as the hierarchy of perceived roles and authority that is common in many digital humanities projects (e.g., the researchers vs the alt-ac contributors). Despite the discrepancy in expectations, one of the most important contributions of the project was in the purchase of scanners and the training of librarians in using them so that they could continue to digitize bibliographic material beyond the project period. Another unexpected difference in expectations occurred as the project progressed in that the Belgian team observed that the interests of Filipino/a researchers involved in digital methodologies were more interested in the study of contemporary media and social networks than in the exploitation of historical newspapers and literary materials as we were in Antwerp. Thus we needed to adapt our teaching plans and expectations regarding the use of the repository. In the following video, more considerations of the project are presented.

*Project PI Rocío Ortuño *Casanova* details the questions the team had to wonder about after designing the project.* *These include financial and resource considerations, ethical considerations, issues with decolonisation and more.*

##### Conclusion

Despite these setbacks, the project met its goals and has produced a unique repository that is used both by academics and the public. The training courses developed have been used and reused, and much to our gratification, several Filipino professors are now teaching Digital Humanities in various universities throughout the country, and at least three of our former students are pursuing PhDs related to Digital Humanities in universities in Europe and the United States. Despite, or perhaps because of the setbacks, for the collaborating teams, the knowledge exchanged was as valuable as the repository created, making us all aware of unspoken assumptions and posiotionalities, which can become a barrier to collaboration and cooperation.

### 3.5 Queerlit: Queer literature and knowledge organization

###### Introduction

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/ac9501705e9494f3138272ce3da0c7746a401f02-71352.png) One of the most important tools for knowledge organization is descriptive metadata. Descriptive metadata can be added to multiple media formats in different contexts: libraries, archives, and museums for instance. It makes it possible for library users to find not just the title or author of a book, but also what the book is about. The descriptive metadata in institutions is usually some kind of controlled vocabulary – a standardized set of terms or phrases used to index content in a consistent way to make it easier for users to find and retrieve content. For libraries, a well-known vocabulary is Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), used to index literature in library catalogs in the United States, but also mapped to subject headings systems in other languages. However, controlled vocabularies, such as LCSH, that offer universalized and authorized terms, have been proven to fail to represent marginalized groups adequately.

One such group is the LGBTQ+ community. There is a long tradition of what Cait McKinney has called “information activism” in this community (McKinney 2020), building resources that facilitated access to relevant materials long before any digital infrastructures. Part of this information activism has also been efforts to change inadequate, pathologizing, and discriminatory terms included in LCSH. In general descriptive systems such as the LCSH, there are different issues, ranging from underrepresentation to misrepresentation in descriptive terms. The situation is similar in controlled vocabularies in other languages used in libraries, but LCSH also has an impact on other national systems, since terms are often mapped from these systems to LCSH. Building on the traditions of information activism in the LGBTQ+ community, separate indexing systems for LGBTQ+ materials have been developed, such as the Homosaurus, an English-language linked data vocabulary, intended to function as a companion to broad subject term systems to make it easier for users to find LGBTQ+ related materials.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/queerlit-636" />

In the project **Queerlit**: Metadata Development and Searchability for LGBTQI\[1] Literary Heritage, the purpose is to create a bibliography of Swedish LGBTQI literature, a Swedish language vocabulary to describe this material, and an interface to make it easier for users to find the subjects they look for. In Sweden, the metadata system used in the National Union Catalog (Libris) is called Swedish Subject Headings (SAO). In it, the terms describing LGBTQI experiences and identities are few and broad. For example, only the general term ‘transgendered people’ exists, while more specific ones such as ‘trans men’, ‘trans women’, or ‘transitioning’ are absent. The Queerlit project developed a thesaurus, QLIT, for the topical description of LGBTQI literature. A thesaurus is a list of terms, which also includes references to preferred and related terms. It is most often organized as a hierarchical structure. QLIT is used in the Queerlit bibliography. Both the Queerlit bibliography and the QLIT thesaurus are interventions into the Swedish National Union Catalog (Libris), utilizing the possibilities of linked data. Linked data makes it possible to use an external resource, such as QLIT, in the library system. This means that the Queerlit bibliography and the QLIT terms are accessible in Libris web search, as well as through the interface developed by the project.

We have chosen to work with fiction and not non-fiction because fiction is usually indexed to a lesser extent. The subject indexing of fiction in libraries is usually limited to genre, complemented with facets of time and place. Libraries seldom have the resources to index fiction more comprehensively, since it involves meaning-making at another level than non-fiction, including metaphors, intertexts, and themes that are abstract rather than manifest. At the same time, fiction is central to the collective history of LGBTQ+ people. It reflects societal values, as well as individual experiences of sexuality and gender identity. Disenfranchised groups, like LGBTQ+ people in history, often leave a lack of historical sources behind, especially narrations told from their perspective. In that light, literature is a particularly crucial source for understanding the prejudices, oppression, and violence that has affected this group, and also for the understanding of subjective LGBTQ+ experiences.

In this video, Jenny Bergenmar explains how the Queerlit project has worked with transformative metadata, and how the QLIT thesaurus has been developed and used in the Queerlit bibliography.

###### Impact in practice

Besides increasing the general level of indexing of literary works, the result of indexing with QLIT is that LGBTQ+ literature is made visible and searchable in different ways:

###### *![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/b6f6722ad4538b988fe75973a596cb134d89e29a-71353.jpeg)Precise subject terms*

More specified terms make more precise searches possible. The novel Moscow baby by Håkan Lindgren (2017) is about a male couple who become parents with the aid of a surrogate mother. The terms “surrogatmödrar” (surrogate mothers), and “homosexuella män” (homosexual men) were available in (SAO). The QLIT terms “Skaffa barn (HBTQI)” (having children), “Bögar” (gay men), “Bisexuella män (bisexual men), and ”Surrogatskap” (Surrogacy) were added. As well as making it visible that the book is not only about homosexual men, but also about bisexual men, these terms also make it possible to search for all books about LGBTQI persons having children, or to narrow it down to homosexual men having children, or to search for LGBTQ+ books including surrogacy.

###### *Major and minor motifs*

The indexing of titles with main LGBTQ+ motifs and characters, as well as titles where LGBTQ+ motifs and characters are more peripheral means that many more titles can be made searchable. That motifs and characters are peripheral is indicated in the metadata itself so that the user can easily see if non-normative gender identities or sexualities are a main theme or only mentioned in passing. Many of the titles also have descriptive text specifying the reason for its inclusion. One example is Viktor Rydberg’s short novel Singoalla (1857). As is the case in older literature generally, there is no explicit representation of same-sex love. However, there are both symbolic elements and a platonic idealization of young male bodies. Like most literary works, Singoalla had a basic indexing in the National Union Catalog with terms for genre, “Romaner” (Novels), and “Kärleksskildringar” (Love stories). The following terms QLIT terms were added: “Antik symbolik (HBTQI) – perifert” (classical antiquity symbolism LGBTQI – peripheral), “Begär (HBTQI) – perifert” (desire LGBTQI – peripheral), and “Svärmisk vänskap – perifert” (romantic friendship – peripheral). The addition of LGBTQI in the term itself serves to avoid overlapping terms. “Begär (HBTQI)” (desire LGBTQI) indicates that this term should be distinguished from the term “Begär" (Desire) in SAO that can be used generally. The inclusion of “perifert” (peripheral) in the term serves as a transformative metadata practice, moving beyond the usual practice of only indexing major themes or characters, and in this way capturing queer characters or actions that are marginal in literary history. The basis of the inclusion of the work and the indexing with the QLIT terms is previous research that has included the author in a queer literary canon and describes the classical symbolism and the same-sex desire.

###### *Symbolism*

The creation of terms for symbolism may function as a new path into a queer literary tradition, capturing more elusive queer characters and actions, and making it possible to compare the use of metaphors over time. The term “Spegelsymbolik (HBTQI)” (mirror symbolism LGBTQI) connects texts in different genres from the early twentieth century until today.

One benefit of open-linked vocabularies is that mapping between different systems also allows the user to trace descriptive links across different resources. QLIT is mapped to the Homosaurus, the largest LGBTQ+ linked data vocabulary, and through this mapping users interested in specific topics relevant to LGBTQ+ cultural heritage can use the same terms to search materials across institutions and media types.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/homosaurus-635" />

###### *Hierarchical term search*

As QLIT is hierarchically organized, an important feature of the search interface is the possibility to search for broad terms and retrieve works indexed with narrower terms. For example, a search for the QLIT term “HBTQI-ungdomar” (LGBTQI youth) will include the novel När jag åker hem (When I go home, 2022) because it has been indexed with the QLIT term "Unga lesbiska" (Young lesbians).

###### Developing the search interface

In the project, two surveys were carried out, one directed towards general readers and one towards librarians. They both showed that the web search functionalities of Swedish library catalogs, including Libris, were unsatisfactory. While the Libris user interface is out of our control, the underlying database is open for public use through an Application Programming Interface (API). The database has great searching capabilities, and its API exposes them to external applications.

The Queerlit interface is built as a web browser application that connects to the Libris database. It translates user input to a query for the API, and then displays the results. This way, Queerlit can leverage the database already developed by Libris, who, on their end, has been an active partner in the project. In several cases, they have been able to develop features for the API to support new use cases.

Our envisioned users span a spectrum from laypeople to researchers. The user interface needs to be unintimidating and inviting to new users. Many of them will not be familiar with all the concepts that are present, such as subject headings, genre keywords, and histograms. We still want them to quickly find and understand how they can use the interface for their benefit. This is true for any user interface, but some expert applications can expect most users to arrive with a clear goal in mind and a willingness to spend some time learning. In consideration of these users, features that require a little more engagement should also be close to hand.

<Embed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3qy-wfsFTM?si=ouSCRblGyUmSwV-o" />

*Video: Queerlit Search Interface* As highlighted in the video linked on the right, the interface uses the subject headings of the QLIT thesaurus as one of the primary means for navigation and searching. While this has proved to be helpful for many users, it is reasonable only in conjunction with our efforts to use the thesaurus extensively when indexing. QLIT terms are visually marked with a yellow "label" style throughout the website. We have recently started performing user testing. These are short sessions where we sit down together with potential users and ask them to perform some common tasks using the application, such as "Find coming out stories about gay men" or "Are there any books by Astrid Lindgren?". We take notes of their usage and their reactions to the interface and then use these as guidance for further development. If we are going to spend days perfecting some nifty autocomplete functionality, we will want to know whether our users understand how to use it.

Since Queerlit is a part of Libris, it has the benefit of being integrated into a large, national library infrastructure, and the literature in Queerlit is visible among all other literature that is searchable in Libris web search. The benefit of the interface developed by the project, on the other hand, is that it builds on specific user needs and domain-specific expertise and that it makes use of the terms in the QLIT thesaurus to help users more easily access literature on specific topics. In this way, the interface is one way of "working that validate\[s] local experiences of data without removing from a more global network of information exchange" (Rawson & Munoz 2019).

### 3.6 Australian Legacies of Slavery

##### Introduction

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/7800e2185cc84a180d53e4eb861939610a7f5c4a-71364.jpeg)The histories and legacies of Atlantic slavery have been receiving increasing global attention. This “slavery memory” boom has been traced back to the latter half of the twentieth century (Araújo, 2012) and has gathered particular momentum in the last decade. With the rise of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, questions over culpability, reparations, and how to remember have been playing out in “statue wars”, memorials, and public debates across the United States and United Kingdom. Nations including the Netherlands, France, and Colombia have for the first time been examining their own roles and ongoing debts in this history through public exhibitions (Rijksmuseum’s Slavery, 2021; Musée d’histoire de Nantes’ The Abyss: Nantes’s Role in the Slave Trade and Colonial Slavery 1707-1830, 2021; Museo del Oro’s On board a slave ship, La Marie-Séraphique, 2018-2019).

In Australia, ties to Atlantic slavery have been uncovered through the nation’s colonial roots. British slaveowners brought wealth, ideas and practices regarding race and labour to Australia, in turn developing several major industries based predominantly on the unfree labour of First Nations people as well as migrants. First Nations people have been experiencing and speaking of racism, dispossession, and historical injustice since colonisation, and Aboriginal people and Australian South Sea Islanders have explicitly referred to their exploitation as slavery (Bandler 2003; Watson 2012, p. 67; Davis 2017). However, the issue of slavery in Australia has only received more widespread attention recently. BLM debates sparked re-examinations of “blackbirding” in the northwest pearling industry and Queensland’s sugar cane fields, while legal claims for stolen wages have brought under public scrutiny the unpaid labour of Aboriginal pastoral workers across the country (Buchanan 2020; Anthony and Gray 2020; Morse 2023).

The Western Australian Legacies of British Slavery (WALBS) project has been uncovering Australia’s colonial ties to Atlantic slavery by tracing the movement of people, wealth and culture from slave-owning Britain to Australia in the nineteenth century. Research has been primarily biographical, identifying hundreds of individuals including British slaveowners, beneficiaries of slavery, and more recently, enslaved people. In conjunction with this research, our project team has been working with software developers at the University of Newcastle who have created the Time-Layered Cultural Map (TLCMap), to plot out the spatio-temporal movements of a selection of these individuals, and to allow for journey-mapping using digital means and data. TLCMap is not a singular map per se, but rather a range of software tools - or “software ecosystem” - that allows humanities and social science researchers to create, share, visualise, and analyse digital maps. Using TLCMap’s Gazetteer of Historical Australian Places, the journeys of six individuals were plotted out on a 3D map. Each journey is visualised by a series of geographical points that users can click on to view information including the dates the individual was there, a brief biographical summary of what occurred whilst there or the significance of this place, and links to relevant images. There are multiple visualisations, including one mode featuring a moveable timeline, and another that links each point of an individual’s journey.

##### Partial data

The WALBS research began by uncovering slaveowners and colonists who benefited from slavery, as it followed the records of payments made to British slaveowners as ‘compensation’ for the loss of their 'property’ – human beings – following abolition. Attention has more recently shifted to tracing the lives of the enslaved. This has raised challenges around the bias of data, as primary (and often secondary) source materials drawn upon are weighted virtually wholly in favour of colonial authorities. Details of colonists and slaveowners document and glorify their own acts, while entire lives of the enslaved are written out of records. Saidiya Hartman (2008) describes how the only glimpses we have of the enslaved are via their brief, distorted, and violent encounters with power. (Projects such as the SlaveVoyages database, which includes data on some 92,000 Africans forced to make the voyage from Africa to and within the Americas, offer notable and large-scale counters to the silences.) Looking at the colonial history of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Malcolm Allbrook (2023) refers to the “hidden population” of Aboriginal men and women who were kidnapped and forced into the brutal work of pearl diving, which many have described as slavery. At best, we know the names and homelands of these people – at worst, a misrecorded “native” name or derogatory “alias” name assigned by the British, and inaccurate or unrecorded lands of origin. Many may not have been recorded at all.

Dealing with missing or “fuzzy” data can be particularly challenging when working with formats demanding precise information. TLCMap requires detailed geographical and temporal data: longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, and dates down to an exact day. When selecting individuals to map the journeys of, this can potentially exclude the enslaved due to too much missing information. In the case of Aboriginal pearl divers, the only traceable locations may be their land of origin and location of work. In the case of slaveowners and colonists, however, detailed biographical data is often available. For instance, we are researching the life of James Stirling, a British colonist with connections to slavery through his naval experience and his family’s commerce, for which there is a dense and thorough biography listing decades’ worth of dates and locations (Staham-Drew 2003). Maps preference colonial data. Many have spoken about the Eurocentrism and colonial bias of cartography. Thomas J. McGurk and Sébastien Caquard describe mapmaking as a “tool of dispossession” that frames and delineates land in economic terms (2020, 52). Map-makers construct templates and variables based on assumptions about what data is of value, and the data drawn upon is constructed according to the biases of those who record and create it. We are developing certain strategies in response to this.

##### Mapping silence and responding to bias

To accommodate the gaps in our data, we have moderated our templates, including “notes” fields that allow us to comment on the way a particular date or location has been obtained. Discussion includes how estimates have been devised, as well as the limitations of the records available. This allows critical reflections on the biases of the archives, and less rigidity in the requirements for data. For instance, mapping the life of William Hickman - a man from Jamaica who was enslaved but later “emancipated” and taken to Western Australia as an “indentured” servant for a British colonist - we are unaware of the date that he arrived in Australia. He is first mentioned when described on 15 January 1830 as a servant to a colonial “master” in the “Swan River Colony” - the river known to Noongar people as Derbarl Yerrigan - in the area of Boorloo / Perth. In the “Date notes” field we are able to discuss the fact that Hickman’s name is not listed on a ship’s register of names, and that often the little we hear of the enslaved are their encounters with colonial authorities. We have also incorporated other materials, beyond geographical and temporal data, that can be visualised and narrated to tell the story of a person’s life. In particular we have placed emphasis on biographical text, first-person quotations, and images, to add more richness and colour to the narrative despite limited archival records.

The use of language and place names also offers ways of navigating bias. Maria Therese Stephansen (2017) describes how Sami activist and artist Hans Ragnar Mathisen’s map of Sápmi creates a counter-narrative to official histories from Norway, Finland and Sweden by presenting the region through the Sami people’s cultural and geographical terms, featuring 920 Sami place names. TLCMap system architect Bill Pascoe (2022), reflecting on the “Massacre Map”, which locates frontier massacres in colonial Australia, refers to questions around the naming of particular sites and massacres that have both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal names. He also discusses the significance of choices around words such as “perpetrators”, “murderers”, “killers”, and so on. For our project we are using First Nations place names in the first instance, with British colonial names listed second. Narrative biographical text describes individuals of interest as “colonists” and “slaveowners” rather than “settlers”, and places terms of ownership in quotations such as “purchased” and “owned”.

Dowling explains, “This painting is about the slavery of First Nation men and women in the early pearl industry in Cossack, Derby and Broome in the north-west of Western Australia”. Including links to images such as these allows us to instil more depth to the lives of those whose stories are barely recorded in colonial archives.*\
TLCMap offers a centralised and accessible space for humanities researchers as well as members of the public to share, build, analyse, and visualise data. We are now exploring the incorporation of TLCMap into a public exhibition on the legacies of slavery in Australia hosted by the Australian National Maritime Museum. This will offer an interactive and digital layer of interpretation, facilitating more ways of learning for wider audiences.

###### This case study is written by Yaming Fu. This case study is designed by Emma Prebreza and Claudio Lo Sciuto.

##### Introduction

The Shanghai Cultural Collections Database (上海文化总库) is a digital humanities platform designed and maintained by Shanghai Library. It integrates a wide range of resources and knowledge databases related to Shanghai city in modern times (1825-1949, from the opening of the Treaty Port at the end of the Qing Dynasty to the founding of the People's Republic of China and beyond), presenting resources that reflect the events, people, life, buildings, and social status as shown in the press and other publications, literature, film, drama, music, art and other categories.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/9fe6a143b5bde0adb6860b28c12c68aaa72272f5-71367.png)*Figure 1: The homepage of Shanghai Cultural Collections*\
These diverse types of resources are linked together on the platform and include books and other collections, old photos, motion pictures, musical records, maps, and audio-visual resources which record Shanghai's historical image and sound; they reflect Shanghai's cultural characteristics and tell the stories and share the knowledge behind the culture. The platform aims to connect the library collections with Shanghai historical and cultural chronology to build a digital Shanghai memory.

##### Rationale for the project

Since 2014, Shanghai Library has constructed digital humanities projects using Semantic Web technologies. The descriptive information of the collections themselves, the related data and the relationships between them are encoded in a standard format via knowledge organization methods and linked data. Knowledge organization methods and linked open data are applied to extract the relevant elements and related details about people, location, time, events, and activities from the appropriate library collection resources with the specific requirements from the users. The knowledge organization method, which combines Bibliographic Control and Authority Control of the library with the technical Ontology, provides the implementation scheme.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/50c1418c9918e59a25c3f7fd8998ec1d3c3336d8-71368.png)*Figure 2: The rationale behind DH projects constructed at Shanghai Library*![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/5e6a86372ac0845040f673e0a63d5a0252d14d8f-71369.png)*Figure 3: The rationale behind Shanghai Cultural Collections platform*\
Traditional historical narratives often focus on dominant perspectives, sidelining or erasing the experiences of marginalized communities. Incorporating diverse resources like archival materials, personal accounts and old photos into a digital platform, can help bring forth the stories of those who have been historically marginalized, promoting a more inclusive and just representation of the city's history. Through making these various types of historical resources accessible via a digital platform, this project serves as an educational tool for raising awareness about the complexities of a city’s history and their lasting impact on social justice issues.

More importantly, as this is the public library in Shanghai, the project and its future development involves collaboration with local communities, giving them a platform to share their personal stories and contribute to the representation of their histories. In our project, ‘\[…] digital methods help us to access and share marginalized or silenced voices and to incorporate them into our work in ways not possible in print or the space of an exhibition gallery.’ (Brennan, 2019). The official records held in the archives and libraries have to an extent been mediated and represent the official record, regardless of the sources, with all the inherent and unescapable biases. In Shanghai these have been particularly influenced by the long-term colonial occupation and the shorter but to an extent more divisive ravages of the Japanese occupation. The prevailing historical record has been unavoidably shaped by these events and factors external to Shanghai and China. As Jennifer Guilliano argues, ‘the embrace of capitalism, and the consequences of colonialism have long affected and been central in the discipline of history’ (Guilliano, 2022. p.5.). This project fills the gaps in the historical and cultural record so that we can ‘ensure that the stories and voices which have been underrepresented in both print and digital knowledge production \[…] can be heard (Risam, 2018. p.129). This participation will empower these communities and provide them with a means for their voices to be heard and acknowledged.

In this project, we also follow cultural memory theory from Assmann and Czaplicka where cultural memory connects together the three aspects of ‘memory (the contemporized past), culture, and the group (society)’, emphasizing the different ways in which communities form their cultural understanding over the course of their history (Assmann and Czaplicka, 1995. p.129).

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-iii-social-justice-in-digital-humanities-practice/9c650bd5ca6563669d5f78ac493d43f3024cc661-71375.png)*Figure 4: Quote from Assmann, 2008* To interpret the inert knowledge hidden in the memory archives, it can be inspected and reclaimed by situating it in a new memory context (Assmann, 2008). Moreover, the feelings experienced in places that carry the passage of time and historical events are more vivid than those experienced by reading. The physicality of place combined with personal history and experience can trigger powerful emotions. Moving through a space ‘at a particular time, in a particular way \[…] might deepen our understanding of human interaction with \[that] place more broadly. It means communicating these things meaningfully as stories or arguments’ (Dunn, 2019. p.156)

##### Why digital humanities

In this project, a digital humanities paradigm and relevant methods are adopted to integrate, link, curate and help to explore various types of historical resources preserved in our library and beyond. Digital methods allow for the preservation of memories and the continued accessibility of the information held in our diverse historical resources. By digitizing archives, old photos, maps, and other materials, these resources become widely available, overcoming physical limitations and ensuring that the information they hold is not lost to time or deterioration. Moreover, the digital platform makes it possible for researchers from various locations and backgrounds to access the information without the need to physically visit the library. This reduces barriers related to geography, financial resources, and physical abilities, promoting equal opportunities for researchers regardless of their location or circumstances.

##### Functions:

1\) This platform serves as a one-stop disclosure of the diverse cultural resources in Shanghai, and provides the exploration on the correlation and interoperability of multiple types of resources through standardized entities such as personal names, organization, and place names.

2\) According to the characteristics of the resources, they reveal various information visually in the form of timelines, maps, films, etc.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/shl-maps-sample-figure-5-681" />

3\) Linked data techniques enable the connection of various types of information. This interconnectedness allows for a more holistic view of the history, connecting different narratives, events, and perspectives. It helps in revealing patterns, relationships, and dependencies that might not be immediately apparent in the traditional, isolated historical records.

*Figure 7: This is a mapping of the relationships of a chosen individual, made possible through linked data*\
4\) Spatial and temporal visualizations, such as Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS), provide intuitive ways to present complex historical data. They allow users to see patterns, changes over time, and spatial relationships, making historical narratives more engaging and understandable for a broader audience.

5\) Users can engage with the platform, explore different resources, and, where possible and appropriate, even contribute their own materials or stories. This interactivity fosters a sense of participation, empowering communities and encouraging dialogue around historical narratives and social justice issues.

By leveraging these digital humanities methods, the Shanghai Cultural Collections project creates a comprehensive and inclusive digital platform that not only archives historical information but also actively contributes to raising awareness, promoting dialogue, and fostering a more just understanding of the city's history and its implications for social justice. The project provides a platform for the voices which are usually excluded from the official record – the marginalized and otherwise less represented citizens.
