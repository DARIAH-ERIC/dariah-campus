This module from the 'An Introduction to Conceptual Modelling' curriculum contains two parts. The first part (2a) discusses entities and relations and attributes, two aspects of properties. Also, it explains what cardinality constraints are.&#x20;

The second part (2b) explores instantiation and classification: instances, classes and multiple instantiation. In addition, Dr Panos Constantopoulos explains what specialization and generalization are:  inheritance of properties, multiple generalization, genus-species hierarchies.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners should be able to:

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners should be able to:

* X
* Y
* Z

## Part 2b

Now that you have completed part 2a, it is time to learn more about instantiation / classification: instances, classes, multiple instantiation; and specialization / generalization: inheritance of properties, multiple generalization, genus-species hierarchies.

## Assignment 2: Simple geography

In this assignment you are invited to build an information model capable of addressing some of the requirements of a geographical information system.

Draw a conceptual schema that supports the representation of statements like the ones below:

* France is a country with an area of 643801 km2 and 67 million inhabitants. Its capital is Paris with 12 million inhabitants.
* Thessaloniki is a city in Greece with 1 million inhabitants at a distance of 500 km from Athens.
* Spain borders France, Portugal and Morocco.
* The river Rhine is 1230 km long. It originates in Switzerland, flows through Germany, France and the Netherlands, and through the cities of Basel, Switzerland; Strasbourg, France; Worms, Basel and Cologne, Germany. It drains to the North Sea through the Netherlands.
* The GDP of Germany was 2580.06 billion euro in 2010 and 282.82 billion euro in 2013.
* The exports of cars of Japan to France in 1987 were worth 2 billion euro.
* Spain has been a member of the EU since 1986.
