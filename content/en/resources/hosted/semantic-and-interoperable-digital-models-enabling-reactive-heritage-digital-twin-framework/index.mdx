This  resource offers a practical introduction to building semantic and interoperable digital models for Reactive Heritage Digital Twins (RHDTs). Using a fictional Temple of Athena as a running example, it explains how diverse cultural heritage information, including documentation, heritage science observations, 3D models, simulations and risks, can be expressed through a coherent set of ontology modules.

The video presents the core principles of the Reactive Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (RHDTO) and its CIDOC-CRM aligned modules, showing how these structures enable interoperability across domains and support reasoning within the ARTEMIS Knowledge Base that is developed in the ARTEMIS project. Also, the resource explains how digital representations evolve through transformations, how scientific and environmental observations are captured semantically, and how simulation and risk information contribute to predictive behaviours in the Reactive Heritage Digital Twin.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, learners will be able to:

* Describe the purpose, structure and modules of the Reactive Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (RHDTO)
* Explain how RHDTO organises and connects heterogeneous cultural heritage data through common entities aligned to the CIDOC-CRM standard
* Identify how 3D models, scientific observations, simulations and risks are semantically represented and interrelated within a Reactive Heritage Digital Twin (RHDT)
* Assess how semantic modelling supports reasoning, provenance, interoperability and long-term reusability of heritage knowledge.

This video describes of how semantic modelling provides the foundation for intelligent, interoperable and reusable knowledge about cultural heritage assets.
