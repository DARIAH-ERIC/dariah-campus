summary:
  content: In this lecture, Teresa Scassa examines the complex role of
    intellectual property(IP) rights in the creation and advancement of academic
    knowledge. While IP rights can create barriers to access, reuse and
    transparency, she argues, they can also further creativity and innovation by
    providing revenue, and by protecting other values such as
    privacy/confidentiality, and integrity/authenticity. IP rights can also, in
    some circumstances, protect against the exploitation of individuals and
    communities. Framing IP rights in terms of a sometimes complex web of
    relationships, this presentation asks what role IP rights should play in
    ethically open science.
