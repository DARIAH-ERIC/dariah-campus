Culture is a phenomenon that is incredibly difficult to capture accurately. In most understandings, it is now referred to as a system of shared beliefs and values of a group of people. Amongst the rapid development of technology and the Internet, the term 'digital culture' has emerged, and it has begun to engulf people in a discourse on whether and how this kind of culture can lend itself to become a heritage. The following material is a basic introduction to the topic of digital cultures and heritages, as well as discussing how they can work together.

Johanna Enqvist is a researcher in Constellations of Correspondence at the University of Helsinki, as well as a member of the Finnish Literature Society. She teaches digital heritage research at the university and is primarily interested in cultural studies, archaeology, as well as connecting that to digitalisation.
