This module from the 'An Introduction to Conceptual Modelling' curriculum gives an introduction on what a data model is and the basic principles and techniques to formulating models that are used for reasoning tasks, both by humans and machines. The module continues to explain symbolic structures in conceptual modelling such as entities, attributes, relations, instances and classes. Furthermore, it discusses how domains are represented and formulates an elementary model for better understanding.

## Assignment 1: Creating an elementary model

You are now invited to build a model to represent information about people and their participation in clubs.

For each person we record the full name, social security number, telephone number, address and spouse/partner. For clubs we record the name, address, telephone number, and annual fee. We also record the members of the club, the president and the treasurer. For each membership we record the start and end date. Similarly, we record the start and end date of the president’s and treasurer’s terms.

Using the simple graphical notation introduced previously, draw a model showing all entities and properties.
