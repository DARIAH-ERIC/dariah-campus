Social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook can be great places for academics to share their research and reach new audiences. In this video, Dr Bob Nicholson will demonstrate the techniques he uses to share his research on Twitter.

His research-based social media accounts (@DigiVictorian / @VictorianHumour) are followed by over 50,000 people and have been featured by BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 3, The Times, The Guardian, Daily Mail, and Smithsonian Magazine.
