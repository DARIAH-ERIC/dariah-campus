Computational methods and artificial intelligence (AI) are making their way to newsrooms more than ever before, and promise to open up new opportunities for journalists, as well as new challenges. This talk provides an overview of how data and Artificial Intelligence can be used in the journalism workflow, investigative reporting and storytelling.
