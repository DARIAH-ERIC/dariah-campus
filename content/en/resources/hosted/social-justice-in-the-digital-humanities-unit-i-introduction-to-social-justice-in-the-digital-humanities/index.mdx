## A Very Brief Introduction to Social Justice

This introduction is written by Sophie Withaeckx.

### Background

The notion of justice is inextricably bound up with the idea of ‘fairness’. Of course, much depends then on what we think is fair. For ancient Greek philosophers, justice was about ‘giving each what they deserve’. But this simple pronouncement conjures up a host of questions: What is it that each deserves? Is everybody equally deserving or are there some who deserve more, or less, than others? Should everybody get exactly the same, no matter who they are or what they do, or should we distribute according to people’s capacities, merit, character…? And importantly, who gets to decide on that?

When specifying his idea of justice, Plato argued that the just state is one in which each person should take on the role that fits them best. This meant that a person excelling in thinking should become a philosopher but also that a person deemed fit to be a carpenter should never aspire to become a statesman… Aristotle added an element of merit: he argued that each should be rewarded according to their inner virtues. But since he believed that not everybody was as well equipped to develop high moral virtues, this also meant that women or slaves – whom Aristotle deemed less able to achieve virtuous conduct – should submit themselves to those having better chances to become good citizens: aristocratic men.

Nowadays, we would find such arrangements rather unjust. To avoid such issues, modern understandings of justice have emphasized the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. Enlightenment philosophers like Kant, liberal philosophers like J.S. Mill, and more recently John Rawls for example, all centralize the autonomous individual, equal to other such individuals in their capacity for reason and therefore, all equally deserving of rights conferred by the state. Rawls famously argued that rules for fairly distributing rights and resources should be drafted under a ‘veil of ignorance’, in order to eliminate any bias we might have when deciding who gets what. However, as early as the 18th century, critical thinkers like Mary Wollstonecraft and Toussaint Louverture pointed out how certain categories of people – like women, Black people, but also children, the mentally ill or the disabled – were systematically excluded from the ideal of the ‘reasonable individual’, thereby reproducing social inequalities and perpetuating injustice.

Modern understandings of social justice emerged in the course of the 19th century. Processes of industrialization produced blatant inequalities between the capitalist owners of production and their employees, whose labor they extracted. Under pressure from labor unions and activists, Western liberal states started to take the notion of fairness more seriously, and social justice became a popular notion to justify policies that intervened in the relationship between capital and labor in order to redistribute resources more fairly (Kalsem & Williams, 2010)

Nevertheless, critical scholarship - like Marxism, the Frankfurt school, different strands of feminist and postmodern thought remained wary of liberal understandings of justice. They took much issue with the individualist logic permeating liberal, and more recently neoliberal and meritocratic ideologies, which tend to hold the individual itself responsible for problems like poverty. Instead, critical theorists developed understandings of social justice that emphasized the structural nature of oppression and discrimination, and argued that such inequalities deeply structure the institutions and social relations of contemporary societies. Demands for social justice then, can be seen as responses to the perceived inadequacies of liberal justice (Barry, 2005).

Social justice scholarship and activism not only takes issue with the idea of the assumedly disembodied, mutually exchangeable, rights-bearing citizen-subject that infuses liberal thinking on justice and freedom. They also challenge the assumption that the state acts in a neutral and disinterested way when conferring rights and distributing resources. Therefore, it remains important to critically engage with notions of ‘fairness for all’, in order to develop more just frameworks for transforming society and fairly allocating resources and rights to its citizens (Kalsem & Williams, 2010, p. 151).

### Feminism, Intersectionality and Social Justice

Feminist scholarship and activism in particular have been at the forefront when grappling with the conundrums of 'difference' and the pernicious effects of inequalities, even within movements who explicitly aim to realize more just societies. Feminist movements inspired by social justice denounce how an excessive focus on individual liberty may result in a lack of recognition of structural oppression and discrimination. Within Western feminist movements, this implied challenging the assumedly universal notion of ‘woman’, as this actually had been modeled upon a white, middle class, heterosexual, able-bodied subject whose needs dominated the feminist agenda and eclipsed the very different backgrounds, needs and experiences of those not conforming to this ideal. Feminist theorizing by women of color, disabled and LGBTQIA+ scholars exposed structural inequalities like white privilege, heterosexism, able-ism, and classism and called for additional strategies to address such inequalities. Social justice then implies attending to difference and recognizing the internal power inequalities permeating social movements. It also requires permanent critical reflection and action to address the pernicious consequences of identity politics that organizes along single axes of identity (Crenshaw, 1991; hooks, 1981; Moraga & Anzaldúa, 1981).

  In this video from Lafayette College, Kimberlé Crenshaw talks about intersectionality and how her thought and activism is guided by social justice.
</Video>

Moreover, social justice is not just a matter of words and commitments; it is a praxis driven by the notion that ‘the personal is political’ and that effective action is needed in order to transform society and people's lives. Gray, Agllias & Davies (2014) identify the following strategies in social justice interventions:

* An archival or archaeological approach: Inspired by Foucauldian genealogy, this implies looking to history to understand how structural inequalities have become shaped and how and why they continue to impinge upon contemporary institutions and social orders. It also implies a valorization of ‘subjugated knowledges’ (Collins, 1990): these are the stories and experiences of marginalized groups that were commonly excluded from dominant accounts of history, but that have the potential to alter our ways of understanding society.
* An intersectional approach: Recognizing how multiple forms of oppression - based on gender, ‘race', class, religion, sexuality, age, ability and other relevant categories of identity – interlock to create injustice. Addressing injustice then requires going beyond ‘single-axis’ understandings of identity, and recognizing the intersectional invisibilities that can make such experiences invisible, both in theory and in praxis (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008).
* A social action approach: This implies a commitment to making material changes to people's lives, thereby prioritizing bottom-up strategies in order to ensure that those most affected by injustice, participate in and benefit from interventions.

### Bottom Up Social Justice

In its emphasis on action, participation, bottom-up strategies and social transformation, social justice values align very well with many of the approaches taken in Digital Humanities scholarship and teaching. Indeed, social justice movements are keen on using methodologies that are participatory, involve the target group in every step of the intervention, and aim to produce durable results that can strengthen marginalized communities.

For example, participatory action research is a much-appreciated method, involving many of the values and principles shared by social justice movements and user-centred design. The following short video made by the Vera Institute of Justice nicely explains the principles of PAR and how this method was helpful in getting recognition for the needs and experiences of young sex workers.

The values embedded in much Digital Humanities scholarship has much to offer for movements, scholars and activists centralizing social justice and can be a helpful tool when transforming the ways we organize and do research.

## (Re)framing Social Justice Digitally

**This introduction is written by Susan Schreibman.**

In 2012 Tara McPherson posed the question ‘Why are the digital humanities so white?’ (MCPherson, 2012). This offhand question in a hallway made during a meeting of Digital Humanists in 2008 gave rise to McPherson’s argument that the desire in the 1960s to ‘control complexity’ (Kernighan, quoted in McPherson, 145), chunking and isolating bits in which the operation of the system is meant to be invisible to the user (McPherson 146), was simultaneously happening in American society itself: moving from overt forms of racism (Whites only signs) to covert forms (such as banking practices that forced people of colour into certain neighbourhoods). McPherson argues that both in society and in computational practices modularity became the norm, segmenting both information and people.

Over the past few decades, several critics have accused Digital Humanists of operating in a in a theory-free zone (Lieu, 2012, Risam, 2015, Bailey, 2011, Risam, 2018, Ruberg 2018) focusing on methodologies that adopt structures and segmentation without questioning their underlying technical, societal, and cultural assumptions. Lieu posited in 2012 that digital humanities would not find its place at the humanities table as an equal partner in scholarship without it developing reflective practices (not just methodological) in incorporating cultural criticism as an integral part of its practice, creating transformative, political action. A decade later, as the case studies in this #dariahTeach course demonstrate, many digital humanists and heritage professions have taken up this mantle in designing digital scholarship, collections, and courses to expose racial injustices, highlight how systems, from metadata to cataloguing systems, replicate and obfuscate gender categories, make opportunities to create new international partnerships, and how scholars from the Global South are taking back their own histories via publicly available scholarship. These projects embed concepts such as intersectionality, not only in their choice of subject area, but in their underlying infrastructures, to expose how societal and cultural entanglements (such as race, coloniality, and class) re-embed themselves systemically in systems we may, perhaps unconsciously accept, as technologies embedded in systems of universal knowledge, highlighting the reframing by democratising the process of frame setting itself (Adam 2020, p.3). This trajectory is discussed by Angel Nieves in a talk given at Amherst College in 2018, entitled Digital Humanities as Restorative Social Justice.

<Video provider="youtube" id="E_XvlNLr_OU" />

The #dariahTeach course, <Link link={{"discriminant":"resources-external","value":{"id":"introduction-to-design-thinking-and-maker-culture"}}}>Introduction to Design Thinking and Maker Culture</Link> contains a subsection on making in the humanities for social justice (section 1.1.5). It highlights two case studies. One by Angel Nieves and the other by Jennifer Roberts Smith who discusses the Digital Histories for Oral Reconciliation (DOHR) project that centres on the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. The digital reconstruction of the home was a collaborative endeavour with the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children,  Restorative Inquiry, and the Victims of Institutional Child Exploitation Society (VOICES) (Province of Nova Scotia, 2020) to combine oral history and place-based research (see Llewellyn, K. and Ng-a-Fook 2019) through Virtual Reality. The combination of these methods provided an ideal frame to explore themes of the past, of discrimination, and of social justice, by creating a sense of displacement in which the virtual illustration provides enough illusion of place to allow new questions to be asked. One of the outcomes of the DOHR project, as described in the video below, is to provide a space for students to interrogate gaps in the documentary record to better understand the past, while ensuring that the individuals who suffered in the Home do not re-experience harm.

<Video provider="youtube" id="vc5f0l6TEsM" />

Risam also addresses this idea of frame setting arguing for Digital Humanities scholarship to be active in the ‘creation of new methods, tools, projects, and platforms’ to attend ‘to gaps within archives by interrogating existing ones and building new ones, considering Indigenous forms of knowledge may be engaged to develop new tools, and seeking the transformative possibilities of technology without ceding to techno-utopianism’ (2018, p.81). A re-representation, if you like. Despite some 30+ years of digital humanities scholarship, much research is still frame setting: developing and combing methods in novel ways, questioning long-established vocabularies, re-framing knowledge and knowledge systems, challenging hierarchies and whose voices get to be heard. At the intersections of social justice and the digital humanities, many developers build into their collection design critical theories and remedial practices with the goal of bringing about social transformation rather than accommodation or incorporation (Ghaddar and Caswell, 2019, 71).

What typifies the current work at the intersections of social justice and the digital humanities is, in Doran Larson’s words, ‘closing material distances’ through virtual interventions, in broaching walls ‘(material, social, cultural, of prisons, plantations, death camps)’ to expose what lies behind closed doors or is buried in the archives, to make injustice visible, both historically and currently, through the various lenses we utilise as humanities scholars. Some projects do this by foregrounding witness narratives, amplifying their voices through online portals, making their testimony available to wider audiences, while at the same time gathering these testimonies into collections which can speak to the wider systemic injustice (Larson 2021). At the same time, the developers of such collections are aware of the responsibility they have towards the documents in their care and the individuals who created them, of the ethical considerations and possible negative repercussions of developing these collections, weighing values such as privacy vs visibility, openness vs confidentiality (Proferes, 2020), for example in making public ego-documents that may have never been intended for public consumption.

Perhaps a unifying principle of much digital humanities scholarship falls under the second of Adams’ Dimensions of Human Injustice Framework: ‘Cultural-epistemic injustices which refer to issues of knowledge, questioning what counts as knowledge and whose knowledge counts’  (2020, p.3). Thus archives, projects and collections are created that have as their underlying purpose a reassertion of rights over indigenous knowledge, as exemplified by the The Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the Researcher’s Responsibilities case study, or in the creation of collections that claim and amplify marginalised voices, as in the The American Prison Writing Archive. Other digital scholarship is centred on methods such as counter surveillance and spatial justice, as in the Walking the Archive of District Six case study, or developed through digital activism, as in the case studies documenting the YEG Police Violence Archive or the International Council of Archives: Archives at Risk Project. Other projects preserve, make visible and publicly available the voices and histories of marginalised communities, as in the case study on the Documenting the American South project).

**\*\*CAPTION?\*\***&#x43;ase studies in Unit 1

Visualisations can be used to highlight inequality and past injustices in ways more powerful than the written word, as exemplified by the Investigating Indentured Servitude case study. Digital humanities scholarship can be leveraged as a corrective to existing knowledge information systems, metadata, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies that replicate historical biases, as in the case studies QUEERLIT database: Metadata Development and Searchability for LGBTQI Literary Heritage project or The SCWAReD Projects). Digital Scholarship can promote access and inclusion, documented by the Digital Humanities Cooperation between Belgium and the Philippines project), expose historic wrongs, as in the case study on the The Rijksmuseum Slavery Exhibition). Digital Social Justice projects can capture and document the process of societal change, as in the The Digital Repository of Ireland’s case study, Reproductive Rights Archive). It can, through critical data studies such as Data Feminism, highlight ways of interrogating issues such as race, gender, sexuality, and class within extant data sets, and providing a framework in the development of new ones.

In many respects, these projects adopt decolonial frames of reference in dismantling meta-narratives and in exposing, questioning, and offering alternative epistemological and ontological structures within the digital paradigms they work within. As such, this scholarship asks questions such as who generates knowledge and from where? Who preserves culture, and from which political and linguistic perspectives? How do we make visible ‘suffering, oppression, repression, domination and exclusion’? (Ndlovu-Gatsheni) And how do we conduct this scholarship in ethical, transparent, and open ways.

## The Prison Writer as Witness: The American Prison Writing Archive

**This case study is written by Professor Doran Larson. The page is designed by Anna Villarica.**

### Introduction

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/15391a8a27651d27709f9d8c9dc4d3dd4bbe6f97-71043.png" alt="American Prison Writing Archive logo" alignment="stretch" />
From a cell in Alabama, Donald Hairgrove writes, “Through silence, isolation, ignorance and indifference society has allowed and even promoted the steady growth of this criminal justice bureaucracy.” Then he lists things he must do to remind himself that he’s still a human being while confined in that state’s notoriously violent facilities. Imprisoned in Indiana, Valjean Royal documented the serial rape she endured as a transgender woman and how she found the strength and resources to resist while maintaining her Christian faith: “I've gained a light of wisdom from the pain of abuse. A light I want to share with others so they can ‘see’ the better choices they can make, even in the dark places.” Georgian Jamil Hayes describes prison units under COVID lockdown, the absence of health care and resulting tensions that lead to “C.O.s shooting inmates with paint ball guns loaded with pepper spray. It’s like a war zone.”

These writers’ witness is hosted by The American Prison Writing Archive, the first fully searchable digital archive of non-fiction and poetry by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside US prisons and jails today. Initiated in 2009 by Hamilton College literature professor Doran Larson’s call for essays for a book collection, Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America (2014), the APWA is the result of incarcerated people continuing to write beyond that book’s deadline. Legally confined writers rushed the gates of analog publication and onto a digital platform, resulting in a living archive of prison witness.

### Rationale for the Project

At just under two million, the people living and working behind bars in the US constitute a major metropolis. This is a prison city not only in sheer numbers but in the coherency of literary witness to the human experience of prison conditions. These writers offer the most extensive corpus of experiential, grounded writing and knowledge about US confinement in our time.

The APWA secures prison witness’ place in our understanding of the carceral state. Contributions from Rikers Island to San Quentin and everywhere in between have established the APWA as a central hub of prison witness for the academy, journalists, activists, civic leaders, system impacted communities and family members. The APWA is responsive to the needs and ideas and aspirations of both the confined and the families and communities they come from, all newly enabled to see and share the suffering, trials, challenges, and freedom dreams that the mass prison seeks to silence.

By gathering the human stories emerging from prison facilities across the nation, the American Prison Writing Archive helps us to measure the full human costs of American legal order, placing imprisoned people at the vanguard of mapping the Prison City that anchors and perpetuates both legalized inequality and the carceral state. The digital presence of these authors stands in direct resistance to the centuries-long efforts of prisons and jails to silence their wards. They thus join a 200-plus year canon of testimony from incarcerated Americans testifying to the utter failure of the prison to achieve constructive ends.

The APWA was initiated, developed and sustained at Hamilton College for over ten years with the support of Hamilton College and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is now housed at Johns Hopkins University and supported by Johns Hopkins and a major grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation. The APWA currently hosts over 3,300 essays, from forty-eight states, over four hundred prison facilities, and includes 1,099 authors. It grows by approximately seventy new works each month. Essays run from one-page cries for help from the unceasing light of isolation cells, to hip-hop inflected shout outs of warning to kids in subjugated communities, to research-based policy critiques, and more.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/prison-witness-contributions-644" />

### **POTENTIAL SIDENOTE??**&#x43;lick on the hotspots to find out more about the works of the authors.

The APWA includes non-fiction essays and poems, newsletters, and more.

In literary testimony from across the nation, we see the prison population emerge as a nearly inexhaustible resource for first-person reassessment of US criminal legal practices, who they target, and their effects on individuals, families, and communities. The counter-narratives in the APWA open the mass prison to humanist scholars and students, the broad public, lawmakers, and the families of incarcerated people. They breach the “silence, isolation, ignorance and indifference” that, as Donald Hairgrove claims, have entombed a carceral metropolis. The APWA poses a singular opportunity for the legally confined to play a vital role in reshaping collective wisdom about carceral experience.

The aim of the APWA is to make prison witness widely accessible, so that when scholars, journalists, policymakers and the public discuss incarceration, they must confront the testimony of those inside. With a current word count equivalent to over forty-one percent of all known North American slave narratives, perhaps the most daunting fact about the APWA is that it has been drawn primarily from a single, quarter-page call for essays in the monthly pages of Prison Legal News. The APWA, even at its current rate of growth, is mounting one of the largest bodies of witness literature on earth, thus documenting the tens of thousands of complex, thriving, damaged, yet resistant lives being led in lockups across the US today, and their collective critiques, experiences, and aspirations.

The APWA has enabled projects that offer unprecedented glimpses into the lived experience of punishment: “The Zo,” from The Marshall Project, presents testimony to the institutionalized disorientation that imprisoned people endure and to their efforts to adapt, respond, and resist; Josefine Zieball’s “Queer and Trans Prison Voices: A Podcast Archive on Prison Abolition” offers the voices of a population living at existential odds with the cultures of the institutions where they are housed; undergraduate and graduate classroom use and theses have illuminated the common narratives that official records obscure; and a network of over two hundred volunteers transcribing hand-written essays and tagging essay contents across four continents—in classrooms, community centers, libraries, and private homes—gives evidence of how the APWA can draw the support of people across borders and demographics.

### Why Digital Humanities?

The APWA is among the increasing number of DH projects that use the digital as a way to challenge social injustice. Prisons are places where social inequalities are both manifest and anchored. People within face abuse and marginalisation, away from the eyes of the wider public. Their stories have largely been told for them - by journalists, researchers, and the legal system, among others. The grassroots, bottom-up ethos of the APWA has bypassed pre-set research or data-gathering agendas, providing an open call for legally confined people to tell the stories they choose to tell. These writers cast off their positions as objects of study and claim the power of narrative witness to their lives, their conditions, and to their essential roles as collective creators of knowledge from inside the grip of the carceral state.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/e81b5544d1d86432cf5534eb0f453c40d396a82c-71045.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
The Archive is guided by the intentions of writers inside carceral institutions. People who have been in or are currently in the prison system contribute as consultants on the project. In addition, the writers themselves provide the contents of the APWA’s metadata. Search fields include the state of origin, keywords, author and date, and are supplemented by author ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and veteran status. The resulting faceted and word searches allow readers to find information quickly. This also allows the diversity of the prison metropolis to be reflected to the reader. A ‘Terminology’ section on the site gives a guide for readers of the meanings of prison-related terms commonly found in the essays, and a ‘Saved selections’ makes it possible for readers to bookmark essays and curate them.

As seen below, the interface includes the scans of the original submissions next to the text transcripts. These original scans reflect the conditions of composition and hint at the unequal distribution of opportunities in the prison system (Larson, 2021, para. 35). Some submissions were sent as typed documents printed off a computer, while others were written with a pen or pencil, reflecting that while some have access to technology, others do not. Some pieces were also published in newsletters, indicating support and resources outside. These are not enjoyed by all.

Larson also suggests in a 2021 essay for Digital Humanities Quarterly that DH as a methodology can facilitate social justice efforts for people in carceral institutions. He relates questions regarding balancing ‘addressing mass incarceration as a statistical fact - as a data set - and/or as a human and humanly articulated condition experienced and documented as discrete individuals’ (Larson, 2021, para. 4) to the debate between distant reading and close reading as methods. Purely computational approaches may run the risk of reducing the testimony of incarcerated individuals to data points, while close reading an individual piece may fail to reveal the larger context it is part of. Thus, the approach Larson (2021) advocates for reading prison witness content is what he calls **cellular reading**. This is reading at a ‘proximal’ distance (para. 14), the middle range which falls between distant reading and close reading. Each written piece is a cell, like in a body or prison architecture. While each piece is a singular statement, it offers ‘context-dependent representative testimony for a collective body’ (para. 2), each piece stands among ‘witness borne by individual human beings who are also exemplars among a mass population’ (para. 13). Throughout the corpus of prison narratives, common themes are found (See Table 1 below). While these ‘’typical’’ moments across the texts carry authority, at the same time ‘each text remains absolutely authoritative regarding the experience, anger, aspirations, hope or hopelessness of its author’ (para. 14). In other words, while computational analysis makes the discovery of themes easier and may become for readers ‘the basis for focused advocacy’ (para. 22), focused reading is also necessary to get a full sense of the unique lived experiences of individuals.

### From Invisibility to Visibility

At the end of her best-selling book, The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander writes, “Isolated victories can be won—even a string of victories—but in the absence of a fundamental shift in public consciousness, the system as a whole will remain intact.” (Alexander, 2010, 234). In 2016, Marie Gottschalk seconded Alexander’s conclusion and underscored the “invisibility of millions” of imprisoned from the public sphere:

> The slave narratives of the antebellum period, which graphically rendered the physical pain that slaves suffered and made it widely visible, helped to propel the abolitionist cause. Today, what happens in prison stays mostly in prison, making it harder to draw connections in the public mind between justice on the inside and justice on the outside. The ability to identify with an offender—or not—is a key predictor of why people differ in their levels of punitiveness.(Gottschalk, 2016, 274)

The American Prison Writing Archive is an effort to do for incarcerated people what America’s slave narratives did for enslaved people: through representative writers, to dismantle public propaganda about who de-legalized people are, the nature of the regime under which they live, and the disastrous personal, communal, and social effects of this regime. It is an effort to do for those legally confined in the US today what witnesses at truth and reconciliation commissions do for themselves and for future generations: to give faces and voices to those on the receiving end of state-sponsored violence, exploitation, and inequality, and to make evident the irreplaceable human stories that witnesses bring to any thinking or public debate about ways to move forward.

To enable fundamental change in carceral policies and practices, and to abandon imprisonment as the default answer to poverty, mental illness, and legacies of subjugation, public perceptions of incarcerated people need the kind of transformation that images of the targets of police violence are undergoing today. The writers in the APWA are already evoking such transformation in the minds of students in classrooms from Berkeley to New Haven, from Baltimore to Santa Clara. In Iowa, California, Maryland, Texas, Connecticut, Indiana, Florida, Idaho, and other states, students are working in and for the Archive as well as doing research and writing based on its holdings. The effects of such work can be profound. As one student concludes, “No other group of individuals is more knowledgeable about the realities of incarceration and the toll it imposes.”

**Exercise: Curation Workshop**\
Curating essays is a valuable experience for students, educators, researchers and casual readers of prison witness. In searching and grouping essays thematically, links are drawn between individual testimonies. It is possible to curate a collection for specific themes, or to help tell stories that may be overlooked. Through curated collections, common themes and narratives come to light. For readers of the website, curated collections are another way to locate essays. Use the template below to curate prison witness testimonies as others have done.

## The YEG Police Violence Archive

**This case study is written by Dr. Kenzie Gordon, Tessa McDougall, and Giovanna Rosal. The page is designed by Felix Bui.**

### **Police Violence Archives**

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0a96a00daa73c595ad255eb7a177dc74070c8294-71053.jpg" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
Police violence archives (PVAs) collect, document, and share incidents of police violence through data, stories, and documentation. PVAs document the most egregious accounts of police brutality as well as more routine, daily abuses by police such as illegal searches, harassment, and racial profiling (Berkeley Copwatch 2022). By highlighting less sensational, daily abuses, PVAs demonstrate the pervasive nature of police violence (Berkeley Copwatch 2022) and call attention to larger systemic patterns of violence and oppression (YEG Police Violence Archive 2023).

#### Community Archives

Community archives are grassroots efforts to collect and preserve historical records and cultural heritage. They recognize that traditional, state-mediated archives and cultural institutions have often neglected the experiences and histories of marginalized groups, leading to the erasure of important stories and perspectives. Community archives seek to address this gap by providing a space for underrepresented communities to actively engage in the preservation and sharing of their own histories.

PVAs founded in community archival practices are tools of community-based accountability that aim to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions. Rooted in BIPOC and LGBTQ2S+-led abolitionist struggles against the police, community-led PVAs share a critical analysis of policing and punishment and recognize that police inherently cause harm to our communities (Drake & Williams, 2017; Stelkia, 2020).

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/yeg-goals-623" />

The common goals of PVAs and some examples of these archives (first slide, from top to bottom): YEG Police Violence Archive, A People’s Archive of Police Violence, and Mapping Police Violence.

##### **The Project: YEG Police Violence Archive**

<Video provider="youtube" id="FmsKE-Rc2rQ">
  In this video, Tessa McDougall from the YEG Police Violence Archive explains why it is important to revise incident reports from news and articles.
</Video>

The YEG Police Violence Archive was initiated in Edmonton, Canada (part of Treaty 6 territory also known as amiskwacîwâskahikan) in 2020 in response to the public surge in interest in the Defund the Police movement, spearheaded by Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, USA. The project is part of a larger campaign led by the non-profit advocacy organization Sexual Assault Voices of Edmonton (SAVE) aiming to counteract the misconceptions that policing is necessary to protect victims of sexual violence. YEGPVA aims to document incidents of police-perpetrated violence in the Edmonton area to give survivor-victims a space to have their experiences of harm recognized as such and validated, and to put information about the forms and patterns of police violence in the hands of abolitionists. Encompassing a wide range of forms of violence, from police killings and sexual assaults, to ‘starlight rides’ and breaking up encampments of the unhoused, to the use of microaggressions and hostile reporting procedures for gender-based violence, the archive attempts to offer a space to recognize the forms and harms that police violence creates in our society.

### **Theory Into Practice**

There are many ethical and theoretical pitfalls associated with the documentation of violence towards black and brown bodies in particular, which the YEGPVA team has sought to navigate. Archives replicate the same biases and injustices present in society (Bak et al., 2017; Williams & Drake, 2017). By relying on documents created by the very people who have perpetrated the violence that we are archiving, we risk replicating existing power structures by accepting the narratives presented (Williams & Drake, 2017). While biases exist within the narratives written by law enforcement and related institutions, biases are also present in the silences created by police documentation (Guberek & Hedstrom, 2017).

Following the work of Berkeley Copwatch’s People’s Database for Community-Based Police Accountability, the YEGPVA employs many archiving practices designed to center accountability and trauma-informed stewardship of knowledge. These practices include data models and custom ontologies that attempt to reframe biased media reporting to a victim-survivor-centered perspective and retain individuals as the owners of knowledge about their own lived experiences. Given that news articles often cite statements from law enforcement, our researchers critically examine where information about incidents comes from and seek out reports that include quotes and first-hand accounts from victim-survivors and their families. When this information is unavailable (which it often is), our researchers “read against the grain” to interrogate and resist replicating dominant narratives of criminality, deviance, and deficit that inform reporting about police violence. Most importantly, YEGPVA is transparent about its archiving practices (and shortcomings) and attempts to draw attention to which voices are absent in a story through details like metadata.

### **Language and Reparative Archival Description**

YEGPVA researchers gather information from a variety of publicly available sources including court proceedings, statements from law enforcement, and news articles to write descriptions of the violence incidents included in the archives. By rewriting descriptions of violence incidents in a way that prioritizes the victim-survivor, we acknowledge the way that police and media narratives are currently used to shift accountability away from the police who perpetrate harm, instead assigning blame to the victim-survivors.

We implement the following reparative description principles in the writing and editing of YEGPVA records:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/11fe36691b3a14dd5f711711a073bd384240b1e3-71054.jpg" alt="" alignment="stretch" />


Our language choices aim to reduce harm and be responsive to community needs and represent the way that members of certain communities prefer to be called; however, we recognize that language is fluid and changing and that not all members of a community may identify with the terminology that we have used.

##### **Conclusion/Future Work**

As a project grounded in the community, the YEG Police Violence Archive will continue to evolve and grow to address the wants and needs of community members, and in response to shifts in the ways that policing is practiced. This could include focusing on other pressing policing-related issues in the community, like the involvement of police bodies in the opioid epidemic or in responding to mental health crises. Central to all future work of the project is an ongoing commitment to self-reflection and accountability to the community.

## The SCWAReD Projects: Scholar-Curated Worksets for Analysis, Reuse & Dissemination

This case study is written by Isabella Magni, Ryan Dubnicek, José Eduardo González, Janet Swatscheno, Glen Layne-Worthey, J. Stephen Downie, Maryemma Graham, and John A. Walsh. The page is designed by Anna Villarica.

### What is SCWAReD?

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f480be7dc872d17f44e8cd8b1ff182d016f39a1a-71063.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
The HathiTrust Research Center’s project on Scholar-Curated Worksets for Analysis, Reuse & Dissemination, orSCWAReD (pronounced *squared*), generously supported from 2020 to 2023 by the Mellon Foundation, produced a suite of scholar-curated, targeted worksets of materials from the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL). HTRC worksets are user-created collections of HathiTrust volumes that can be treated as data and analyzed using a variety of tools and services. Worksets can be shared and cited, contributing to research reproducibility and durable scholarship. In addition to their intrinsic value as focused digital collections, SCWAReD’s enhanced, scholar-curated worksets also serve as illustrative, reusable research models and include not only the worksets themselves but also scholarly introductions, derived datasets and related documentation, and research reports, demonstrating the collaborative workset-building, textual analysis, workflow development, and dataset creation activities typically carried out by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC).

The special mission of SCWAReD is to highlight and center the work of historically under-resourced and marginalized textual communities. For this purpose, a flagship project and four additional projects were selected; each explores new methods for creating, analyzing, and reusing curated digital library collections and their resulting research data.

### The SCWAReD Projects

#### Black Book Interactive Project in HathiTrust

HTRC partnered with SCWAReD co-PI Dr. Maryemma Graham and her team (Jade Harrison, Ashley Simmons, and Brendan Williams-Childs) at the University of Kansas to develop a flagship research model based on the Project on the History of Black Writing (HBW). HBW was founded in 1983 at the University of Mississippi by Dr. Graham and has been hosted since 1998 at the University of Kansas. Its principal activities include the creation of the largest known bibliographic database of African-American literary texts in existence; a robust program of summer institutes for professional development and student engagement; community building; and research publishing. HBW’s more recent project to create and curate digital full-text versions of works documented in the bibliography is subsumed under the Black Book Interactive Project (BBIP). The motivating question for BBIP is this: How well is the largest known bibliography of African-American-authored texts reflected and represented in the largest known academic digital library? With a combination of advanced metadata matching and methods in textual analysis, this SCWAReD flagship project seeks not only to answer this question but also to remediate some of the discovered gaps by seeking sources for as many missing texts as possible, developing new ways of incorporating as many of these into the HathiTrust Digital Library as possible, devising new ways to derive data from those texts that cannot be ingested into HathiTrust, and creating SCWARed worksets and research models from all the diverse sources that we are able to gather.

#### Projects Selected for SCWAReD-Funded Advanced Collaborative Support

On top of the Black Book Interactive Project, four additional projects were selected through a competitive process to create, document, and analyze the corresponding worksets, in collaboration with HTRC. They are outlined below:

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/four-projects-640" />

*Click on the image hotspots above to find out more about the four projects*.

### III. Supporting Diversity in Digital Humanities with Worksets

The SCWAReD project helps to answer ongoing calls in the digital humanities to diversify both research and dataset production, partially through the emphasis on collaboration, which Isabel Galina Russell has identified as a fruitful avenue “towards achieving a more inclusive and open” digital humanities (2014, p. 315). In addition to Russell, Risam (2015) and Mahony (2018), among many, have called for a shift from the North American, English-centric data and study in digital humanities. Assembling and publishing expert-curated worksets of traditionally marginalized items, along with associated scholarly documentation and general sets of derived data is designed to help inspire both new work in non-traditional research areas of DH as well as help lower the barrier of entry for new scholars to engage in digital humanities research. SCWAReD projects are also designed to serve as a replicable model for meaningful collaboration, especially aimed at including new and non-traditional research and researchers. Prof. Kim Gallon, a SCWAReD project director and prominent voice in Black digital humanities, identifies a new Black digital praxis influenced by the notion of the workset. Key to this praxis are the concepts of community building and participation; recovery and iterative data collection, documentation, and analysis; and viewing the workset as a living product that can support user tags and metadata additions (Gallon, 2021), concepts that are also at the heart of SCWAReD.

</Video>

#### Filling the Gaps

Diverse collaboration can often only take the field so far, as digital humanities research is at the mercy of data quality and availability. Given the legal history of text and data mining (Grimmelmann, 2016) and corresponding digitization policies and initiatives, the search for relevant materials for non-canonical cultural research is often one that ends with empty hands. The SCWAReD project attempts to pilot and examine a workflow for filling gaps in incomplete digital collections–gaps that too often silence voices and perspectives at the periphery. The emphasis on recovering and documenting existing marginalized (or “hidden”) portions of collections implies the discovery and potential remediation of gaps in a digital library collection that hopes to be reasonably comprehensive.

The causes of neglect and marginalization of certain texts and textual communities are many, beginning with historical injustices related to the social, economic, and cultural conditions in which these texts were first produced, distributed, collected, and preserved \[1]. What we must recognize, and what our project seeks to address, is that such injustices persist in library collections and continue today in our own library practice. The HathiTrust Digital Library is only as complete as the collections of its contributing member libraries, in which historical injustices are of course reflected. At the same time, similar historical injustices have impeded the development of infrastructures required to allow under-resourced non-member libraries (many of which have collections that could indeed fill important gaps) to join HathiTrust and contribute. The SCWAReD project cannot, of course, even begin to address the deepest of these injustices, nor can it remove the barriers to participation in HathiTrust. But what it can do is to identify some of the intellectual consequences of those injustices (“collection gaps,” for want of a better term), and adopt innovative strategies for outreach and engagement in the recovery and inclusion of missing materials through available means \[2]. Below we explore in more detail one of the five SCAReD workset projects, José González’s Worksets for Spanish American Fiction.

### IV. Case Study: Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction \[3].

#### Rationale for the Project

While the majority of volumes currently included in the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) are written in English (51.1%), Spanish only accounts for 6.5% of the 17.6+ million current total volumes\[4].*Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction* (directed by Prof. José Eduardo González) aims to create worksets of relevant items available in HTDL - both in and out of copyright - for scholars interested in Spanish-language literature, and in particular Spanish American fiction. Working towards multilingual digital humanities communities, projects, methods and practices has been at the center of several conferences and publications in the past decade. Isabella Galina Russell’s pivotal question “‘who is ‘we’?” (Galina, 2014, p. 307) and her remarks on the general status of digital humanities as “a reflection of the way academia works in general with English as the predominant language and with a few countries having a far larger representation and research output” (Galina, 2014, p. 314) still resonate today, though many efforts have been made since then to promote a more inclusive and multilingual DH \[5].

An additional goal of González’s project is indeed to incentivise the use of digital and computational methods - and in particular quantitative methods - for the study of Spanish American literature. Lastly, this project will help HathiTrust to identify and potentially rectify gaps in HTDL collections of Spanish American fiction, contributing to a less English-centric and more inclusive HTDL. *Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction* includes six worksets, each focusing on different literary periods, genres or styles (To these, a seventh workset of “Unsorted fiction” was compiled in part as a comparative set to use for analysis purposes, and in part as a continued effort to compile and share lists of Spanish American novels available to researchers in the HTDL, classified by country of origin):

#### Building Worksets

The six (plus one) scholarly-curated lists of volumes assembled by Prof. González, were used to perform automatic searches of the HTDL. The searching process developed in three main phases: 1) pre-processing to correct errors and normalize data (title/author lists); 2) searching the published HathiFiles (an up-to-date listing of the entire HTDL holdings which includes bibliographic metadata) for matches for each title/author combination from the list provided; 3) reviewing search results to evaluate matches and identify any potential false positives. Searching was done via fuzzy string (text) matching to allow potential variations in spelling of both the title and author names. Around 68.9% of volumes searched were found in the HT digital library, with the following breakdown by genre:

#### Analysis Results: The Case of the Mexican Revolution

Using the seven worksets described above, Prof. González performed analysis aimed at automatically identifying each of the six genres, using the “Unsorted” list as a comparative set. The initial goal was to apply techniques that had previously been successful at studying and detecting literary genres in English-language worksets to texts written in Spanish and produced in Latin America. This process used a predictive “logistic regression model” trained on examples of each genre and then given unseen samples to classify. Below is a brief description of results related to the Narrative of the Mexican Revolution genre.

Characteristics of the genre: One of the most successful genres in Latin American literature is a specific narrative that originated in Mexico during the revolution against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz between 1911 and 1921, thereafter labeled as “novel of the Mexican Revolution.” Though critics have long debated whether these novels constituted a “genre”, there are common characteristics that identify this group: common topics related to the revolutionary uprising, and tendency to combine literature, politics and history.

Analysis results: The analysis was performed in two different batches: volumes published between 1930 and 1950 (Figure 5), and volumes published between 1950 and 1960 (Figure 6).

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/comparison-of-1930s-1950s-to-1950s-1960s-638" />

*Figures 5-6: Slide to the right to focus on the 1930s-1950 (Figure 5);*\
*Slide to the left to compare against 1950s-1960s (Figure 6)*

As Figure 5 shows, the logistic regression model experienced problems detecting this genre from randomly chosen volumes published between 1930 and 1950. Not only are some of the random volumes considered part of the genre, but also several of the books labeled as novels of the revolution received low predicted probability numbers, potentially undermining the argument for these novels as a distinct genre. This will come as no surprise, especially for those familiar with the history of the Mexican Revolution genre: as González underlines, the high number of noisy labels in the data originate from the fact that many competing literary publications - not easily distinguishable from those considered narratives of the Mexican Revolution - were simultaneously published during those first few decades, speaking perhaps to characteristics of writing of the era rather than the genre.

Meanwhile, Figure 6 shows that the Mexican revolutionary novel is more easily distinguishable from other products in the Mexican literary field of the 1950s and 1960s. As González underlines in his Report, “this outcome is not simply the result of very few new novels being published in a dying category, but of the nationalistic discourse of the 1930s running its course”.

The SCWAReD team at the HathiTrust Research Center and the many scholars with whom we are working to developed these curated worksets continue our work and will be releasing additional worksets, data sets, and reports as they become available in the coming months. We hope these five worksets, focused on making available for research volumes relevant to historically under-resourced and marginalized textual communities, will be the first of many and we look forward to partnering with other scholars in the future to continue this work.

### V. Availability

Access to HathiTrust data through HTRC is informed in part by the concept of *non-consumptive research*. Non-consumptive research simply refers to research that does not involve traditional human reading (or consumption) of the original text and thus does not violate copyright or licensing restrictions. Examples of non-consumptive research include computer processing of texts, such as the generation of word-frequency lists and lists of named entities (e.g, proper nouns).

Most HathiTrust Research Center tools, datasets, and services are freely available to the worldwide scholarly community. Any user may analyze HathiTrust volumes through the various web-based algorithms available on the HTRC Analytics site. These include our Topic Model Explorer, Named Entity Recognizer, and Token Count and Tag Cloud Creator. These algorithms access the full-text directly on our servers. The results are provided to users but not the raw full-text of the volumes.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7903747c76dac73f4748ec83b28a449998a01711-71066.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
*Figure 7: The interface of the HTRC Analytics web environment*\\

Anyone can access all the derived datasets included in the github repositories for each SCWAReD workset. These include Extracted Features data for the workset, which consists of volume- and page-level metadata and page-level arrays of all the words that occur on the page, with their corresponding part of speech and occurrence counts. These extracted representations of the workset include all the words (or “tokens”) in all its volumes, but since the words don’t appear in their original order they are also *non-consumptive,* and thus open to all.

The HTRC Data Capsules provide a secure computing environment for researcher-driven text analysis on the HathiTrust corpus. In the data capsule, researchers may download arbitrary software and libraries or run their own code to analyze the full-text files directly. Data capsules with access to in-copyright volume are only available to researchers affiliated with HathiTrust member institutions.

Lastly, HathiTrust makes available the full-text of all volumes in their Digital Library deemed to be public domain, or not under copyright. A volume’s status as public domain is based on many factors, including the location of the user wishing to access the data. More information about this program and available data can be found on the HathiTrust datasets webpage.

### The North American Slave Narratives Digital Library

This case study is written by Professor William L. Andrews. The page is designed by Felix Bui.

#### **Introduction to the *North American Slave Narratives Digital Library***

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5f853685729c815f1ee265a1e9a41724851a8c82-71069.jpg" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
The great slave narratives of U.S. history and literature provide shocking evidence of the unimaginable depravity of America’s “peculiar institution,” as its defenders termed it. Those same narratives also contain inspiring testimony to the dauntless fortitude and faith of those who endured enslavement, overcame it, and bore witness against it. The most powerful stories in the U.S. slave narrative tradition are invariably the ones that have been verified as true. The fact that they are true, that they hold a mirror to U.S. history in a unique and still compelling way, makes these narratives essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the origins of racism and white supremacy in the United States.

Narratives of the lives of formerly enslaved people are also the foundation on which African American literature was built. In 1849, the noted white transcendentalist clergyman Theodore Parker stated, “All the original romance of Americans is in them \[the slave narratives], not in the white man’s novel.” While slave narratives dramatized appalling trauma suffered by Black Americans across the United States, North as well as South, many of these narratives also portrayed various forms of resistance to oppression that the enslaved engaged in. The most popular narratives published between 1840 and 1865 focused on the heroic and highly dangerous escapes of fugitive slaves from the South to the North. Fugitive slaves such as Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Henry “Box” Brown, and William and Ellen Craft became internationally celebrated figures whose narratives sold in the tens of thousands in the United States and Great Britain and were translated into other European languages.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/nasn-famous-narratives-619" />

North American Slave Narratives (NASN) was launched in 1999 with the goal of making the entire corpus of African American slave narratives up to 1920 available to readers around the world. Over the last four decades of the 20th century, the narratives of the famous fugitive slaves of the mid-19th century had gained increasing visibility to scholars and teachers in the United States. However, the large majority of the slave narratives published before the abolition of U.S. slavery in 1865 remained unfamiliar, especially to the American general public, and inaccessible to readers beyond U.S. borders. North American Slave Narratives was designed to represent all the voices of the enslaved that had been preserved in print up to 1865, not just those whose stories had become famous. Another key goal of the project was to ensure that anyone with access to the internet anywhere in the world could read any text in the slave narrative tradition at no charge.

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/nasn-screenshots-616" />

***CAPTION:** The screenshots of the North American Slave Narratives digital library.*

Funded by a substantial grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and supplemented by grants from private funders, NASN was conceived by its Series Editor, William L. Andrews, E. Maynard Adams Distinguished Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The UNC-CH Library provided funds that supported the work of NASN’s Project Manager, Natalia Smith, and dozens of UNC-CH graduate students who worked with Ms. Smith to ensure that each text underwent rigorous editing, encoding, and review before it was published online. The final report on the project to the NEH in September 2001 noted that 230 slave narratives (35,337 pages) had been placed on the NASN site, including not only autobiographical texts but biographical and fictionalized ones as well. Nowhere else in the world does a digital library of African American life-writing of such breadth and historical import exist for readers worldwide and at no charge to those who read or download materials from the site.

The editorial philosophy of the project required the texts to be based on scrupulously transcribed digital copies of original editions, many of which were shared with the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by libraries and special collections far and wide. Because many of the original editions of the narratives are unavailable to readers today, when possible the transcribed and digitized texts of these narratives are accompanied by reproductions of visual images included in the original texts, as well as reproductions of the front and back matter (including any author portrait that appeared as a frontispiece for a slave narrative). In some cases, the front and back covers as well as the spine of a slave narrative published as a cloth-bound book also appear in NASN. Various additional explanatory materials, such as summaries of texts and other writings published by or about the narrators themselves, are linked to many texts in NASN. In addition, the site features a bibliography of all the narratives on the site in alphabetized and chronological listings as well as a compact introduction to the history, influences, and import of slave narratives to U.S. as well as African American history, literature, and culture. An example of one of the illustrated books is below.

North American Slave Narratives received designation from the Southeastern (U.S.) Library Network as an Outstanding Library Program in 2000. It has been reviewed or cited positively in scholarly journals such as *Library Journal* and *Higher Education* and praised in articles released by the Associated Press and in newspapers such as the *Washington Post*. The site has grown to 294 texts, in a few cases because of the addition of texts, hitherto unknown to scholars, that were contributed to NASN by descendants of the narrators of these exceedingly rare texts. Over the past five years (April 2018 – April 2023) NASN has amassed 5,432,608 page views, an average of over 1 million visits to the site annually.

</Video>

Before 1865 slave narratives by and about Black males vastly outnumber those by or about Black females. By far the most influential pre-1865 female-authored slave narratives was and still is Harriet Jacobs’s *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* (1861), which depicts the author’s resistance to her enslaver’s sexual exploitation and her ultimate achievement of freedom for herself and her two children. However, in many narratives by males Black women in bondage are portrayed as pitiable victims, in an attempt to highlight, as Jacobs put it, the many ways in which “Slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more terrible for women.”

However, images of Black women in slave narratives are not limited to those of tragic victims. Consider two enslaved women who appear in Douglass’s *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* (1845) and his second autobiography, *My Bondage and My Freedom* (1855). The first chapter of the *Narrative* contains a horrific account of the whipping of Douglass’s aunt Hester, which the author witnessed as a child. Compare the depiction of Hester in 1845 to Douglass’s boyhood memory of Nelly, an enslaved mother whose “impudence” to a cruel overseer touched off a hand-to-hand fight between the two (*My Bondage and My Freedom*, chapter VI). Notice the reactions Douglass attributes to each woman during and after the whippings they received. Nelly does not appear in Douglass’s *Narrative* of 1845. But in 1855 Douglass told her story only a few pages after recounting the whipping of his aunt. What might account for these differences between Douglass’s two autobiographies?

## The Intersections of Social Justice and Digital Humanities Pedagogy

###### This introduction is written by Susan Schreibman and Anna Villarica. The page is designed by Anna Villarica.

### Introduction

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f7a8bd9f703314d033644c50e01c5f2715e6bac5-71075.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
The pedagogic intersections between social justice and digital humanities is a relatively recent phenomenon, even within the relatively young field of digital humanities. The examples we found are less plentiful than, for example, courses that focus on an introduction to the field or on a specific methodology. Nevertheless, since c. 2015, there has been an increasing number of courses that specifically target the intersection of these two spaces, theoretically and methodologically, typically taking a praxis-based approach to learning and teaching. Some of these courses rethink how students are assessed and engaged, for example, through syllabi that encourage student-led projects focusing on social impact, exposing inequalities or societal injustices (a gathering of these can be found at the FemTechNet Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Pedagogy Workbook, pictured on the right). There are also several sites that amalgamate or create resources, including Teaching and the Digital Humanities (2015) and Digital Humanities for Social Justice (2023), as well as this course, for instructors who would like to incorporate exercises, assessments, and/or readings at the intersections of social justice and digital pedagogy.

This introductory page is divided into three sections. Section I provides examples of DH courses within a methodological and theoretical framework. In section II we highlight several digitally-inflected project-based assessments. Section III provides a list of resources for instructors wishing to incorporate social justice themes into their Digital Humanities teaching.

### Methods and Theories

Digital Humanities is one of many fields in which instructors have begun to take an intentional approach in integrating social justice themes into their methodological practice. In his 2020 article ‘Between Social Justice and Decolonisation: Exploring South African MOOC Designers: Conceptualisations and Approaches to Addressing Injustices’ Taskeen Adam provides a framework for three lenses for what he terms *Dimensions of Human Injustice.* These lenses, e.g., material, cultural-epistemic, and political/geopolitical, provide a framing that instructors adopt, depending on their own positionality, educational goals, and methodologies chosen. These lenses also play a part in the instructor’s own views on how society shapes the ‘ways in which they understand and approach student difference and disadvantage’ (Keddie 2012: 264). Central to course design is about choosing the best methodology(ies) to address specific injustice(s):

> ...some placing greater emphasis on cultural-epistemic injustices embedded in geopolitical inequalities, and others on material injustices that need addressing at societal and national levels. This approach assists in putting aside narrow interpretations of particular discourses, for example, social justice being equated to economic justice, or decolonial movements being interpreted as Africanisation, towards a more holistic mindset that can better tackle the multiple dimensions of injustice in our educational contexts and bring about learning designs that better support learners (Adam 2020:2).

DH instructional design is an extremely good fit for raising student awareness of societal injustice, inequalities, and privilege, as the praxis-and team-based approach of many DH courses provide opportunities for truly transformative education, informed by context, the ‘situatedness of knowledge, and the necessity for education to respond to the needs of that context’ (Nnenne as quoted in Adam 2020: 7). DH courses can demonstrate to students the inclusivity of making visible issues such as dismantling power relations, social hierarchies and cultural hegemonies via public-facing assignments (Luckett and Shay, 2017: 3).

***CAPTION:** Watch here a presentation on challenges*\
*of DH teaching (Carnes and Smith, 2022)*

Digital Humanities pedagogy is not only relevant at the university level. Educational institutions, at both the university and secondary school levels, in St Louis, Missouri, have formed a consortium funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. This is a network for supporting and disseminating methods in digital humanities pedagogy. The goal of the network is to not only bridge the K-12-college divide, but advance digital humanities pedagogy and access for underserved populations, with a focus on student learning.

This focus is key, particularly at institutions in which students, ‘especially those from poorer or more marginalized backgrounds, miss out on learning the valuable, 21st-century skills that DH can train them in’. Their white paper (Carnes and Smith, 2022) and presentation outline the difficulties of integrating DH teaching and learning at institutions that do not necessarily have the staff trained in DH methods, nor the resources, to engage in praxis-based teaching. The consortium-based approach was taken to expand access, narrowing the inequality gap.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8f5113a080c9ad819c27e8c60acae53900c889ed-71077.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
Another area of DH pedagogy beyond university level, is peer-to-peer training outside of formal curricula. In recent years, workshop designers have been embedding, beyond DH theories and methods, a third pillar into their training: that of social justice. The 2023 open access edited collection *Digital Humanities Workshops: Lessons Learned*\*,\* pictured on the right, demonstrates how important professional DH training beyond the Global North in building local expertise and networks (for example, in chapters on the Indian, African, and Taiwainese experience), but also how to build into one’s curriculum design (no matter where one teaches) social justice concerns, as in Kush Patel, Ashley Caranto Morford, and Arun Jacob’s chapter on ‘Workshops in Anti-Colonial Digital Humanities Towards Building Relationships With Critical University and Community Movements’ (whose work also features as a case study in this unit).

Here we highlight several courses, at the undergraduate, MA, and professional levels, that embed in their instructional design, a number of the aforementioned theoretical approaches. These, at the time of writing, have syllabi or another format of online presence. Courses are presented from the most recent to the oldest. The majority are from North America as these institutions most frequently tend to make syllabi available online. We acknowledge that this list is incomplete and would very much welcome further examples. If you have a course you would like us to feature, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) with course details providing the information below. If there is no additional information available online, you can send us a PDF of the syllabi, and we can upload it into the #dariahTeach database.

### Project-based teaching

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b6f429dd0467d8548dd54f3aa1c38f3e53fa4117-71078.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
As mentioned above, many courses utilise project-based assessments. Here we drill down into how some instructors have taken a praxis-based approach. As was the case with syllabi, this is only a very small sample of project-based assessments. If you would like your project-based assessment listed here, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) with information similar to what is below. We welcome contributions from conference or symposium panels and instructors. If there is no additional information available online, you can send us a PDF of the or conference abstract syllabi, and we can upload it into the #dariahTeach database.

A good place to start with project-based assessments at the intersections of social justice and the DH is the 2015 panel on *Teaching and the Digital Humanities* held at Emory University. Panel participants stressed the importance of projects that encourage students to critically engage with digital tools while producing work that is relevant to their communities, providing opportunities for students to be critical, not only of the digital tools and methods they employ, but the communities in which they live and work. An example of this is Anne Cong-Huyen’s course at UCLA in which she guided her students in creating an open-access digital book in Scalar entitled *Ethnic Los Angeles* (pictured on the left and published in 2014). Students conducted research by immersing themselves in communities they would not have normally visited and reflected on the politics of publishing as they were producing the book. Ultimately, the book revealed the racial and ethnic tensions in Los Angeles, allowing students to write an alternative representation of their city. Cong-Huyen remarks:

> It was proof that undergraduate students can do high-level, original scholarly research if we provide them with innovative, interdisciplinary digital methodologies and analytic frameworks.(Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015)

At the same symposium, William G. Thomas III, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, described how he encourages students to engage in projects that are publicly available on the [WWW](http://WWW). These allow students to reflect on the affordances available, becoming ‘producers working in a critical fashion with an in the digital medium’. He cited a few examples from his teaching, including student contributions to established projects like The Valley of the Shadow (University of Virginia) and History Harvest (University of Nebraska-Lincoln).

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/596a1a3767d5c17ab0761644f5aef8304e3f9c1a-71079.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />


*The Valley of the Shadows* project is a digital archive of primary sources from people from Virginia and Pennysylvannia who experienced the American Civil War. In teams, undergraduate students contributed new content to add to the archive. In one instance, a sub-project on US coloured troops became so popular it received emails from the public, and the student team continued to manage the site and engage with the public years later. *History Harvest*, on the other hand, is a collaborative project where students themselves make history by creating digital resources documenting the history of their communities. In creating this digital archive, students engage community members in sharing their stories and artefacts, ultimately to ‘create the possibility and digital space for a more diverse, inclusive, and democratic narrative of American history’ (*Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015*). According to Thomas III, such projects become:

> a kind of transitional, porous engagement in which students long after remained responsible for and committed to an ongoing interactive engagement in the digital medium. (Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015)

Another example of praxis-based pedagogy centres on community engagement and collaboration, which is central to UCLA’s Data Justice Scholars program. This program is open to UCLA juniors and seniors from all disciplines. Beyond reading courses on the social justice implications of working with data (this year, “Whose Lives Count?: Race, Gender, and Data” and another related course of their choosing), students also conduct data-based research that impacts their community. This gives them a chance to work with LA community partners and apply what they learned in a real life context. The current cohort of students will present their research in the 2024 spring Undergraduate Research week. The scholars also help enhance the Los Angeles Data Justice Hub, an online educational resource featuring resources on how to use, analyse and present data for data justice projects, curated open datasets and project samples.

Apart from the larger projects mentioned above, there are examples of students engaging in smaller-scale research. This is being done for example at the Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies (GWSS) division at the University of Minnesota, which uses ‘academic technologies for feminist pedagogies and to situate the digital turn in higher education for the purposes of social change’ (‘Digital humanities for Social Justice’, 2023). Students produce media that engage core concepts in their programmes and contribute to social change. Among them are documentaries, digital essays and interactive maps (see examples below). Through such projects, students not only think critically about media and digital tools, but also reflect on how to apply their technical skills to create change-making media.

## Anti-colonial Orientations for Digital Humanities Work: Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed Collective

This case study is written by Dr. Ashley Caranto Morford, Dr. Kush Patel, and Arun Jacob. *The page is designed by Felix Bui.*

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/1563ae8d5d7e3514cd91e74c49e62d59691b3ec5-71092.jpg" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
In 2018, we co-founded the ***Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed*** collective to foster anti-racist, queer-feminist, anti-caste, anti-ableist, and anti-colonial approaches to digital humanities (DH) research and teaching, and to build digital research and pedagogical coalitions and communities across the Global South and Global North. Our collective contends with questions of colonial histories embedded within the historically white, upper caste, and resource-rich classroom environments as well as the often unexamined genealogies of commonplace digital tools used in DH research and teaching for digital storytelling, online public writing, and community archiving. We also structure our work around the material and infrastructural realities of educational care work (Friend, 2021), highlighting and challenging the post-secondary institution’s increased adoption of digital surveillance technologies in classroom building, and its ongoingly neoliberal metrics of digital scholarship productivity and promotion. In each of these ways, and following Paulo Freire’s writings on the Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Freire et al., 2009), we cite the knowledge of our collaborators and those of community intellectuals and wider scholars to “unveil” the interrelationships of oppression between digital and analog worlds (Morford, Jacob, and Patel, 2021).

### Why anti-colonial?

We are intentional in our choice of the word “anti-colonial” in our collective and praxis. Anti-colonial spaces seek to name, confront, contend with, and, as the “anti-” in anti-colonial elucidates, to challenge and resist the ongoing legacies of colonialism, and yet, these spaces are not necessarily the same as decolonizing or decolonial spaces. While the terms “decolonize” and “decolonial” get used repeatedly within post-secondary spaces at the moment, we remain skeptical about the ability of these institutions — built on and entangled in legacies of white supremacy, casteism, classism, ableism, sexism, cisheteropatriarchy, anti-Blackness, and settler colonialism — to truly participate in decolonizing and decolonial processes, which, as the “de-” in the words suggests, undo colonialism. Further, as educators and organizers like Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang remind us, decolonization must center concrete, tangible, material restitution of lands and life to and for Black and Indigenous peoples (Tuck & Yang, 2012). We align with the assertion by bell hooks that classrooms can be radically transformative spaces for social justice learning and organizing and for resistance to the status quo (hooks, 1994). We attempt to foster learning spaces and practices that are accountable to, that contend with and resist ongoing colonial processes, and that imagine relational otherwise against and beyond the current status quo (Patel, Moford, and Jacob, 2023). But we recognize that our current positionings within post-secondary institutions limit and arguably render impossible our ability to craft truly decolonizing spaces and processes at this time, and, thus, we use the word anti-colonial. For more on the nuanced distinctions between decolonial, decolonizing, and anti-colonial concepts and processes, we recommend the work of Lydia Ayame Hiraide (2021) and Gail Omvedt (2011).

> Where the prefix 'anti' expresses pure opposition, \[...] 'de' positions decolonisation as a more obviously continuous and reiterative process, which not only seeks to overthrow colonialism, but also the remove and redress its lasting traces and legacies afterwards.  (Hiraide, 2021)

*“Postcolonial, Decolonial, Anticolonial: Does it Matter?”.*

### What about infrastructure?

We align with Susan Leigh Star’s idea of infrastructure as not merely being limited to the technical but, rather, as being relational, land-based, corporeal, human, and, thus as interwoven, rooted, embodied, and living sociotechnical ecologies, acknowledging the relations and locations of power among people, in online and digital spaces, and on/to land (Star, 1999). We must be mindful of how it is that infrastructures are not always-already technologically efficient. Rather, technical infrastructures impede the social, material, structural, and embodied cultural experiences of people who are dis/articulated from mainstream society vis-a-vis the installation and implementation of infrastructural affordances (Costanza-Chock, 2020). Jean-Christophe Plantin and Aswin Punathambekar rightly point out how we are living through the infrastructuralization of digital platforms, and how a critical infrastructural lens enables us to think through and about digital platforms vis-a-vis questions of scale, labor, and cultural practices, policies and regulations (Plantin & Punathambekar, 2019). This is to say, how is it that the pace of digital humanities course adoption in institutional settings is thought through more carefully, wherein the labourers who toil in digital humanities labs and centres are not left in precarious conditions. And in the clamour to build cultural records involving archival works, digitization projects, and community-centered learning, we must be mindful of what sort of harms are replicated as more and more computational efforts and large language models trod through these cultural records.

The online instructional infrastructures that we labour in/under make clear how it is that teaching in this mediated space is not just simply about delivering content over “wires and lights in a box” (Murrow, 1958). There are technodeterminist implications to this move, the ideological temperament that the instructors themselves must espouse both within and across geographical specificities. As an online instructor, one does not merely perform the pedagogical tasks, being a content matter expert, mentor, coach, and so on. Here one takes on the added responsibilities of being a commercial content moderator (CCM) when using chat rooms, discussion boards, or video conferencing software; a podcaster and/or vlogger, if one produces asynchronous teaching and learning material using audio-video technologies; a virtual help desk to help students navigate instructional software issues and on occasion deal with student hardware and software issues; and even moonlight as an instructional designer to ensure that the course design meets universal design for learning principles. As an online instructor, one is expected to walk into the job having all these competencies, fluencies, and literacies, that is, they are expected to be reified into the infrastructures of subjectivation and responsibilization.

### Pedagogy matters!

The following three teaching engagements from ***Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed*** form a case study that calls on researchers and educators to consider the possibilities of working at the intersections of digital humanities and anti-colonialism. As you move through the various parts of this case study, you will engage with guidelines for ongoing community building that also outline our orientations to infrastructures that run through, alongside, or even beyond the educational institutions we inhabit. This case study introduces anti-colonial digital humanities accountabilities, histories, perspectives, and methods, reflecting particularly on how to practice digital pedagogies committed to anti-colonialism. We present and invite you to spend careful and care-filled time with these three contexts of our work, each connected to a) furthering digital conscientization; b) practicing care work; and c) reimagining process as product in DH classrooms.

## Anna Julia Cooper talks back on a 1930 survey of Black college graduates: Digitizing an historic Q & A with TEI

This case study is written by Elisa Beshero-Bondar. This case study is designed by Annica Opitz and Karina Meyer.

### Introduction: A defiant presence on the page

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/896c31b5aba9952c5e0565b51fb794ecf714cb27-71101.jpeg" alt="" alignment="stretch" />
It's unusual to be able to encounter a manuscript or even a digital photo facsimile of one unless you're a specialist yourself or know your way to finding them. Looking at those papers can make the past seem to come alive as if you're meeting someone in person, through the distinct marks of their hand on paper. We have a course in my program titled Text Encoding, a method used to remediate manuscript or published text into machine readable format for online presentation and searching, designed to introduce students to writing a kind of code that models information structures in documents of many forms, including manuscripts. In the late months of 2020 as my Text Encoding class struggled with multiple modes of virtual and physical class presence, we also found ourselves in the virtual, mediated presence of a remarkable Black woman activist. We witnessed this activist writing in, around, and against the lines of a survey form, a lively voice of retort against the printed lines on the pages. Anna Julia Cooper, the fourth Black woman from the United States to earn a PhD, and later the principal of the famous M Street high school for Blacks in Washington D.C, helped to introduce my students to manuscripts and why we want to spend time reading and researching them. These were the months following a summer of social justice activism after the killing of George Floyd, and somehow it mattered for us to meet Anna Julia Cooper just then and to witness her writing defiantly against imposed forms.

By 2021, Cooper's responses to an occupational survey of Black college graduates became the work of a digital scholarly edition we created that fall, guided by me and led by my student Alice Rong. I like to think the work we did together that year celebrates something vitally important to Cooper herself: the connection of educated colleagues and the formation of communities of teachers and students.

My students and I knew very little about Anna Julia Cooper when we started this project. We came to know her thanks to a generous introduction and a kind invitation from Shirley Moody-Turner, Director of the Center for Black Digital Research at Penn State University. Dr. Moody-Turner has been researching, locating, and engaging people with early 20th-century Black women activists and is an expert on Cooper, having helped to digitize her papers at Howard University, having edited those papers in The Portable Anna Julia Cooper, and having been working on a forthcoming biography of Cooper. Moody-Turner shared some resources and suggestions for my students to try encoding Cooper's writings, but one topic stood out as a fascinating challenge: What could we do with Cooper's lengthy and intricate responses to a survey of Black college graduates in 1930?

The writing seemed to rebel against the survey's tidy lineation for short replies. One response to question 65, "Have you a 'racial philosophy' that can be briefly stated?" was later excerpted by Cooper scholars as an essay in its own right, printed in The Voice of Anna Julia Cooper (1998) and most recently in The Portable Anna Julia Cooper, where Moody-Turner describes the the way it was written: "In her handwritten responses, Cooper's writing loops around the typed text of the questions and continues into the margins and onto the back of the pages" (516).

***CAPTION:**  Figure 2: The hotspots above reveal the journey from handwritten text to the digitised version: from the original version on the top left, the encoding on the bottom left, and the display version on the right.*

When Dr. Moody-Turner showed the survey to me, she shared the difficulty of processing crowd-sourced transcription of a typewritten form with handwriting that exceeded all bounds. While crowd-sourced transcription through interfaces like Zooniverse works typically with small frames of text on the photo facsimile page, it does not help with following handwriting that moves out of narrow page bounds. We recognized this as a challenge well suited for text encoding, where we could mark and organize answers with questions, following those answers as they traveled over many pages. I am grateful to Moody-Turner for guiding us to one of the most important, relevant documents we could possibly share with a university undergraduate class for their first sustained encounter with manuscripts. We were privileged to witness a defiant and courageous act of writing against the grain of a printed page.

### Anna Julia Cooper and the Survey of Black College Graduates in 1930

The defiant voice we encountered seems woven into the daring professional person of Anna Julia Cooper. The fourth Black woman from the United States to earn a PhD, Cooper earned her doctorate in 1925 at the Sorbonne in Paris in a moment when she was very much at odds with the prevailing infrastructure for Black education in the U.S. She had been principal of the famous M Street high school for Blacks in Washington D.C., yet at the time she set off to complete her doctorate in Black revolutionary history she had been fired from her post for seeking to establish college preparatory coursework and for advocating the same curriculum for all students (Moody-Turner xxv-xxviii). Cooper and her peers were being pressured to institute a less ambitious curriculum limiting Blacks to segregated vocational roles, but Cooper resisted compromising. She had consistently pressed for change throughout her own schooling, asserting that she should be able to learn the same elite coursework limited to white men during her time as a university student at Oberlin in the 1880s.

At Oberlin College, one of the progressive Seven Sisters Colleges in Ohio open to men and women of color, Cooper earned an undergraduate bachelor's degree in 1884 and a master's in mathematics in 1887. Protesting segregation and containment seems woven into a life of advocacy for unlimited education, most famously articulated in her book, A Voice from the South, by a Black Woman of the South (1892). That book makes a provocative statement, that educated Black women must lead progressive reform for Blacks and women alike. Cooper's work as an educator is repeatedly marked by acts and bold statements that she herself described as "courageous revolt," a revolt that succeeded in sending her students to elite universities (Moody-Turner, Portable xxvi - xxvii). Cooper dedicated her life to finding pathways for people to succeed in a position to think independently and ambitiously, and that dedication is evident in the remarkable responses she wrote on the survey she received in 1930, headed "Negro College Graduates: Individual Occupational History."

The author of the survey project was Charles Spurgeon Johnson, who was born in 1893, a year after Anna Julia Cooper published her Voice from the South. Educated in the 1920s as sociologist at the University of Chicago, he was a member of educated Black culture, like Anna Julia Cooper but in a different field of expertise. He became chair of the Department of Sociology at Fisk University in Nashville Tennessee, and from that position he launched a survey of college-educated Blacks in the U.S., collected results in the early 1930s, and from them developed a data-driven study in The Negro College Graduate, published in 1938.

The occupational survey was surely intended to be progressive, led by a Black sociologist to better understand economic conditions and demographic trends among educated Blacks in the US. Yet clearly the survey questions sent to collect data for Johnson's occupational study sparked tension with Anna Julia Cooper. Frequently it seems she found there was not enough space to address some complicated matters, and occasionally she questions the questions themselves. Here is a portion of the survey that is full of critical backtalk:

<H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ethical-lens-1-669" />

**CAPTION:** \*Figure 3: \*This slider compares the original version against the transcribed and encoded version, capturing Anna Julia Cooper's backtalk in very different ways.\*\*

\
To question 36, "How well did you do in college?" Cooper snaps back, "Hardly a fair question for personal answer" and continues trailing upside down on the top page margin in a rather challenging passage for us! A little later (shown in the same image), question 38 asks, "What is your attitude toward educational methods of instruction in college? (Mention the strongest and weakest features?" Cooper retorts indignantly, "Too broad to be answered in 2 lines." And characteristically, she continues and finds space anywhere she can to write a full and serious response.

The survey that Anna Julia Cooper filled out, to be clear, was just one of hundreds of data points, collected and aggregated as a whole. Yet as far as I and my students know, at least, Cooper's completed survey is the only one we have seen filled out by an individual by hand. It would be a fascinating illumination of early 20th-century Black history of education to find more such, and yet Cooper's is certainly a distinct voice worthy of excerpting from the quantitative demographic survey work of Johnson's book. While that book occasionally features quotes from individual surveys, it does not seem to have taken note of Cooper's response. Instead, her survey contributes to charts like this one from Johnson's book:

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/fb66b2aa1827c41fc0d455fd5026f4bceca3dc0e-71096.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />


**CAPTION:** \*Figure 4: Table of data on Black female college graduates from The Negro College Graduate, 156.\*

The manuscript of Anna Julia Cooper's written responses shows a remarkable talking back, a debate, a voice at odds with the surveyors that has a lot more to say than they formally expected. At the time of this writing, we do not know how Cooper's rather vocal data point was processed by Charles Johnson or his colleagues at Fisk University. Johnson's sociological book tends to aggregate responses and speak to patterns over multiple years of survey collection, and when it speaks of remarkable individuals they tend to be male. Perhaps the curation of the survey as sent in 1930 can show us what was assumed by progressive data collectors in 1930 about educated Black Americans, what was assumed about their personal lives and history, their parentage, and to what heights they could aspire.

The survey Cooper received in 1930 was six pages long, with the last page reserved for "special comment." Her writing, as we have mentioned, thoroughly fills those pages. Multiple responses overflow the printed lines for a response, and some responses, in particular to questions 46 and 67 reflect on views of race and of education and are continued on the open last page, numbered and marked to guide the reader. Cooper's passion for learning and teaching is profoundly expressed.When the survey asks, "As you regarded it then, what motives prompted you to go to college?", Cooper responds, "innate & indomitable 'wanting to know'". When the survey asks, "Are you at present employed upon the occupation of your choice?", Cooper answers, "Yes." The survey continues, "the vocation for which you were prepared?" and Cooper responds, "the Education of neglected people." When it asks if the respondent votes where they live, Cooper responds, "None do." Frequently Cooper's responses take issues with the language or presumptions in the survey questions, such as when the survey asks the respondent to identify racial factors that interfered with finding a chosen career: Cooper appears to take issue with the notion that her racial identity would have interfered with her goal to teach, but also comments on how her students were blocked access to scholarships they should have been able to apply for.

Patricia Collins in Black Feminist Thought highlights the importance of particular tensions and frictions in Black women's experience as reminders that interpersonal conflicts reflect "intersecting oppressions, for example, intersections of race and gender," and that a "matrix of domination" describes the organization of those intersecting oppressions (18). The complex position of Anna Julia Cooper being interviewed by Charles Johnson is full of intersectional sparks that perhaps illuminate a conflict over authority to define the condition of race and the significance of a college education sharply in the decades before the Civil Rights era in the U.S. Cooper's hand both replies and critiques, taking issue with the page in a way that absolutely calls for close reading and document analysis, where the survey form becomes a kind of dialogic groundwork inspiring Cooper's most memorable elucidations on race and education.

### TEI for handwriting on a survey form

To share the manuscript survey and try to make it readable and searchable online represented an exciting challenge for us. We set out to represent the document to share the interactions of Anna Julia Cooper's handwriting with the printed survey questions. We wanted our work to show a dynamic back-and-forth: how Cooper's responses rounded against the questions, how those responses push against the restraints of the expected answer, how they expose the survey authors' assumptions.

We needed to figure out the best way to distinguish the handwritten responses from the printed survey. Should we code the survey questions in a separate document or separate portion of our file? We opted against this because the questions and answers seemed to represent a unit of thought: something like a call and response that needed to be stored together in context. There was no pattern for this that we could find in the TEI Guidelines or previous projects, and perhaps what we began here can be a starting point for future work on formal documents like surveys and others that combine print and handwriting in meaningful ways, documents in which the handwriting on its own is not complete without the print context it is addressing, and where the handwriting is an equal partner with the print, more than simply annotation or marginalia.

TEI is a markup language with many possibilities for many different kinds of texts, from dictionaries to poems, from stage plays to scripture, and from descriptions of page surfaces and handwriting to printed documents. It's a good idea for TEI projects to deliberately make choices about encoding for consistency, and to limit all the possible tags we could use. My students and I spent about two weeks in October doing "exploratory markup," that is, finding ways to mark the document using the TEI Guidelines. My students' individual homework assignments involved taking a small section of the survey of their choice, and choosing how to encode it after reading chapters and examples from the TEI. Preparing for class in those weeks, I compiled the students' homework files and took the best developed versions and reworked them with my own code. We would discuss different approaches in class. While this case study cannot in itself constitute a thorough orientation to the TEI, our approach has always been "ad hoc," looking at examples and setting students to work exploring and combining and reviewing together with me as a guide. In the end we came up with a combination of markup forms using the TEI numbered div elements and the \<ab> element to hold questions, and setting the \<add> element inside them to hold Cooper's responses. You can see the document structure we created in the TEI file:&#x20;

To make the text searchable for scholars of Cooper's world, I asked students to apply persName, placeName, and orgName markup from the TEI. Later my students would be able to extract this information into a navigational guide to the people, places, and organizations Cooper mentioned as important to her educational trajectory and life's work.

***CAPTION:** Figure 6: Our TEI encoding of question 22 with Cooper's response, showing encoding of an early important influence on her teaching career, Dr. J. Brinton Smith. You can also see that at the time we did not encode every proper name, leaving out book titles. This coding can always be added later! Given time constraints of a university semester, we prioritized capturing certain information about people and places and organizations in Cooper's life.*

One idea that I prepared in our plans, but that never caught on with the students was to store in attribute values two counts: a count of lines provided in the survey document to answer a given question, and a count of lines actually written by Cooper. I envisioned a sort of measurable Metric of Resistance in noting a) how frequently and b) by how much Cooper's responses exceeded the lines printed for responses on the form. We could divide the number of lines Cooper used by the count of the lines provided for each question, and then calculate the averages as our Metric of Resistance. Though we never followed through on it in establishing the edition, perhaps we can go back and add this feature someday.

### Student encoders and interface designers

One of the delights of working with TEI is the number of different ways you can build with it. Because TEI systematically expresses document structures and ideas and information about the text (or metadata), we can write code that extracts many different kinds of information, use it for analysis as well as for displaying illuminated visualizations of the source text. In digital humanities work, this is an area that combines creativity, graphic design, and scholarly analysis of curated documents. One of the most important, vital creative portions of the Text Encoding class is when students learn to write XSLT to design their own HTML pages from the TEI they prepared.

My student Alice Rong worked on the transformation of TEI with XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheets Transformation Language) to create an HTML file and prepare CSS (cascading Stylesheets). These forms of code are related and part of the topic of our class: to learn text encoding and what you can build and design with it for sharing on the web. The forms of code mention styling and were modeled on older pre-computer technologies used in print publishing. Blocking and layout follows a design concept that Alice developed. At first, like most of my students, Alice wanted to use a computer handwriting-style font to show Cooper's handwriting, but I cautioned:

1. That this might not be easy for people to read, and
2. The digital edition does not need to look like the original in order to be accurate and authentic to the source document.

On reconsideration, Rong came up with a design that would mimic the way a PDF form looks to us when we fill it out. A distinct font and CSS styling would set off the writing of Cooper from the typeface of the survey. Other forms of styling would help to indicate passages we could not read, as well as signal when parts of the document would overflow to other pages. Finally, information could be "pulled" from the markup to help create a directory of proper names marked in the survey, designed to assist scholars in finding their way to interesting information.

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7d9a69b1f728616271975afd332ad35c8155bfe2-71097.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />


***CAPTION:** Figure 7: Above is a screen capture of a portion of the reading view that Alice Rong prepared, using XSLT to transform TEI XML to HTML. You can see Cooper's responses, as well as some information supplied by us (some editorial "metadata") in red over grey background to describe when the writing is cut off or moves out of bounds supplied by the survey form.*

\
In the limited time of a university semester, we concentrated on the problem of representing this text, though in a real way the text itself was our guide to the vexations of Anna Julia's life as an accomplished, highly literate Black woman attempting to make a difference as an educator in the U.S. of 1930. Alice designed a preview screen for the digital edition to help people find their way to questions mentioning particular people, places, and organizations of interest. (As an XSLT challenge, this could be redone as an index, listing only the distinct people once, and providing a list of questions.)

<Figure src="/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities-unit-i-introduction-to-social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/64d2dd61d577515a8df0220885724df85ee235bb-71098.png" alt="" alignment="stretch" />


***CAPTION:** Figure 8: Alice Rong's design of a table to preview the survey questions and link directly to those mentioning particular names of interest.*

Though I wish that my students had time to investigate more of Cooper's context, they really dedicated themselves to the considerable challenge of representing the document and powerful voice they were encountering. And they thought carefully about how best to design an interface to represent the complexities they could model in code. Perhaps there is a limitation in a technologically-driven digital humanities class that prioritizes learning markup and code: there was so much to do here to plan the text encoding and to build and design the web interface that we had to choose how much we could accomplish within school time. Perhaps it is best to think of this as a project in building groundworks and establishing foundations for continued work, in which we find undergraduate students without a strong background in history able to study a manuscript and learn to trace its events on the page. Most of my students do not think of themselves as historical scholars, but they do think of themselves as graphic designers and web developers, and the act of curation gave them a new and worthy challenge.

In the spirit of digital humanities projects, perhaps they are never really finished and we create them in stages in hopes that they continue some other way, some other time. This digital project is freely shared with a Creative Commons license requesting that if the work is re-used, its developers be properly cited, that the reuse not be for commercial profit, and that it be shared on the same terms with others. We hope this is a micro-edition worth exploring, forking, and building on by other students and scholars who find their way to Cooper perhaps as we did.
