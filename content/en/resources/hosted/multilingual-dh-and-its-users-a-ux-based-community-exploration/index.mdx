    Although research and teaching in most (digital) humanities disciplines are
    largely multilingual, our institutional infrastructures still often fall
    short in accommodating our scholarly linguistic and geo-cultural diversity. 
    This presentation, delivered as part of the DARIAH Friday Frontiers webinar
    series, addresses needs and challenges of multilingual DH practitioners,
    through highlighting their broader relevance to the field, and staging a
    performative component using fictional (but revelatory) interviews with the
    personas.

Although research and teaching in most (digital) humanities disciplines are largely multilingual, our institutional infrastructures still often fall short in accommodating our scholarly linguistic and geo-cultural diversity. Having studied the resource gap of knowledge infrastructures and its implications for advancing multilingual digital research, in this talk we argue that there is a specific role to be played by the digital humanist, first in drawing attention to the realities of our larger DH community, and second in lobbying for the design of workflows which assume multilinguality (and multiscriptual and multidirectional characteristics).Â  A wider conversation is urgently needed amongst global DH practitioners and knowledge infrastructure designers/managers about these issues. Drawing on methods in the UX community, we have developed six data-driven user personas from the DH community (a graduate student, a professor, a librarian, an academic technology specialist, etc.) The talk addresses needs and challenges of multilingual DH practitioners, through highlighting their broader relevance to the field, and staging a performative component using fictional (but revelatory) interviews with the personas. This double mode of the talk demonstrates how the theoretical implications can be translated to individual knowledge actors and ultimately lobbies for more linguistic and geocultural diversity.
