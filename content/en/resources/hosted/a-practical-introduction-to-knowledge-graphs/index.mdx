## Description

The course offers an extensive introduction to the topic of Knowledge Graphs. We explore their basic principles, demonstrate the benefits of their use and examine various digital methods for their design and creation from text. Specifically, following a real use-case scenario -that of modeling and transforming Humanities research articles into a scholarly knowledge graph- we examine the application of various digital methods involved in the entire workflow concerning the design, creation and use of Knowledge Graphs: from organizing and representing domain knowledge, to textual data processing, information extraction, entity disambiguation and linking as well as linked data generation and query formulation.

## Objectives

Develop a practical understanding of how diverse methods and techniques converge in the construction of Knowledge Graphs. This includes grasping the core principles, functions, and value of Knowledge Graphs, as well as engaging with the broader ecosystem of digital methods that support their creation. Learners will examine how knowledge representation within the Semantic Web provides a conceptual and technical foundation; how text processing and manipulation enable the transformation of unstructured content; how entity extraction, linking, and disambiguation contribute to building coherent semantic structures; and how linked data generation and SPARQL querying facilitate the production, interconnection, and retrieval of machine-readable knowledge. Along this line, the central objective is to understand and apply the full synthetic process through which these components interact to form robust, meaningful, and interoperable Knowledge Graphs.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, participants are expected to be able to:
•	Understand the main idea and benefits of using Knowledge Graphs.
•	Assess the basic concepts behind the Semantic Web and the benefits of representing knowledge as linked data.
•	Assess the core ideas behind RDF and RDFS data models in order to work with knowledge representation tasks in the Semantic Web.
•	Design Knowledge Graph schemas in Python using the RDFS data model.
•	Employ Machine Learning models for Entity Extraction using SpaCy NLP framework.
•	Disambiguate extracted entities using Public Knowledge Bases such as Wikipedia.
•	Create semantic relationships among the extracted entities using inference rules.
•	Combine information from different sources (metadata, text) in order to build a Knowledge Graph.
•	Publish Knowledge Graphs as linked data for the Semantic Web.
•	Perform basic SPARQL queries in order to retrieve information from an RDF Knowledge Graph.

## Prerequisites

Students must be familiarized with Python Programming Language.
In addition, there is extended use of the Python libraries: RDFLib, as well as SpaCy NLP framework.
This course utilizes digital methods and tools from various computer science topics such as conceptual modeling, RDFS, Machine Learning, entity extraction, entity disambiguation, SPARQL. Each mentioned topic is briefly reviewed and explained to make the course comprehensive and self-sufficient. Nevertheless, for more in-depth understanding, additional bibliography and resources will be provided on each occasion.
