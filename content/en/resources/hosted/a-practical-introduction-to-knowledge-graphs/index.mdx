  title: A Practical Introduction to Knowledge Graphs
  content: >-
    The course offers an extensive introduction to the topic of Knowledge
    Graphs. We explore their basic principles, demonstrate the benefits of their
    use and examine various digital methods for their design and creation from
    text. Specifically, following a real use-case scenario -that of modeling and
    transforming Humanities research articles into a scholarly knowledge graph-
    we examine the application of various digital methods involved in the entire
    workflow concerning the design, creation and use of Knowledge Graphs: from
    organizing and representing domain knowledge, to textual data processing,
    information extraction, entity disambiguation and linking as well as linked
    data generation and query formulation.
