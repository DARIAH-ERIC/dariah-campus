## Description

The course offers an extensive introduction to the topic of Knowledge Graphs. We explore their basic principles, demonstrate the benefits of their use and examine various digital methods for their design and creation from text. Specifically, following a real use-case scenario -that of modeling and transforming Humanities research articles into a scholarly knowledge graph- we examine the application of various digital methods involved in the entire workflow concerning the design, creation and use of Knowledge Graphs: from organizing and representing domain knowledge, to textual data processing, information extraction, entity disambiguation and linking as well as linked data generation and query formulation.

## Objectives

Develop a practical understanding of how diverse methods and techniques converge in the construction of Knowledge Graphs. This includes grasping the core principles, functions, and value of Knowledge Graphs, as well as engaging with the broader ecosystem of digital methods that support their creation. Learners will examine how knowledge representation within the Semantic Web provides a conceptual and technical foundation; how text processing and manipulation enable the transformation of unstructured content; how entity extraction, linking, and disambiguation contribute to building coherent semantic structures; and how linked data generation and SPARQL querying facilitate the production, interconnection, and retrieval of machine-readable knowledge. Along this line, the central objective is to understand and apply the full synthetic process through which these components interact to form robust, meaningful, and interoperable Knowledge Graphs.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, participants are expected to be able to:
•	Understand the main idea and benefits of using Knowledge Graphs.
•	Assess the basic concepts behind the Semantic Web and the benefits of representing knowledge as linked data.
•	Assess the core ideas behind RDF and RDFS data models in order to work with knowledge representation tasks in the Semantic Web.
•	Design Knowledge Graph schemas in Python using the RDFS data model.
•	Employ Machine Learning models for Entity Extraction using SpaCy NLP framework.
•	Disambiguate extracted entities using Public Knowledge Bases such as Wikipedia.
•	Create semantic relationships among the extracted entities using inference rules.
•	Combine information from different sources (metadata, text) in order to build a Knowledge Graph.
•	Publish Knowledge Graphs as linked data for the Semantic Web.
•	Perform basic SPARQL queries in order to retrieve information from an RDF Knowledge Graph.

## Prerequisites

Students must be familiarized with Python Programming Language.
In addition, there is extended use of the Python libraries: RDFLib, as well as SpaCy NLP framework.
This course utilizes digital methods and tools from various computer science topics such as conceptual modeling, RDFS, Machine Learning, entity extraction, entity disambiguation, SPARQL. Each mentioned topic is briefly reviewed and explained to make the course comprehensive and self-sufficient. Nevertheless, for more in-depth understanding, additional bibliography and resources will be provided on each occasion.

## Designing Knowledge Graphs for the Semantic Web

### Introduction

In this section we will delve into the world of Knowledge Graphs and the representation of knowledge in a structured -machine comprehendible- way. Specifically, we will focus on designing Knowledge Graphs for the Semantic Web. We will explore their role and usage in knowledge representation, we will explain their relationship with conceptual models like ontologies and familiarize ourselves with the RDF / RDFS languages for designing our models and the SPARQL language for querying our knowledge graphs. Finally, we will go hands on with building a schema for a knowledge graph using the RDFLib Python Library. So, let’s start from the beginning by answering the most important question:

### What is a Knowledge Graph?

A Knowledge Graph (KG) is an organized representation of data in the form of entities and their relationships. Entities can represent various concepts (such as real objects, events, persons, or types of entities), while the relationships among them capture their semantic context, meaning they describe how they are connected. Typically, KGs are implemented in a form of Directed Labeled Graph, meaning a structure of interconnected i) nodes and ii) links among them. Both nodes and links bear a label that is used for describing their semantic meaning in natural language. In addition, the links can bear a direction, that describes how their semantic meaning is applied (i.e. from which node it starts and to which node it ends).&#x20;

As an example, consider the phrase: “Parthenon is located in Athens”. Using the above principles, we could represent the knowledge encoded in the above phrase as a directed labeled graph, where two nodes represent the Parthenon and Athens and a relationship *isLocatedIn(Parthenon,Athens)* links Parthenon to Athens based on the semantics declared by its label. This transformation is shown in the following figure.

### Why Knowledge Graphs?

The usefulness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) lies in the way they organize data in the form of a network of interconnected concepts. This inherent structure allows for easy exploration and retrieval of information (by traversing the graph) as well as the inference of new knowledge through the application of inference rules, network analysis algorithms, graph embeddings etc. In addition, when combined with Large Language Models such as Chat-GPT, KGs can help increase response accuracy and improve explainability with the context provided by data relationships. This is achieved, using Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG), a technique that grounds LLMs with domain knowledge. For the above reasons, KGs can be very useful in many use cases of real-world applications such as Fraud Detection and Analytics in Financial Services, Banking and Insurance, investigative journalism, drug discovery in healthcare research, recommender systems, etc. In fact, the entire web can be considered as a huge knowledge graph with websites and digital resources linked to each other. Access to that knowledge graph is witnessed every time we use our familiar search engines like google search:
