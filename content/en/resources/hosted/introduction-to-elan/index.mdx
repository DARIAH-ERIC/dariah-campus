This course introduces learners to the annotation tool **Eudico Linguistic Annotator (ELAN)**, developed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and the **FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx)**, a tool to build your own dictionary. ELAN supports transcribing, annotating and visualising audio and video material. It is designed to create layered or tiered transcriptions. The number of annotations is unlimited and can include anything from translation, comments or feature descriptions. ELAN is a free, open-source tool and runs on various operating systems.

## Introduction

In this introduction to **ELAN** and **FLEx**, you will learn what these tools are, what they are used for, and how they work together. We explore the basic structure of ELAN files, the advantages of using ELAN for transcription, and how FLEx helps you build your own dictionary. You will also see how the two programs can be combined—how you can transfer material between ELAN and FLEx, and how glosses created in FLEx can be imported back into your ELAN transcriptions.
