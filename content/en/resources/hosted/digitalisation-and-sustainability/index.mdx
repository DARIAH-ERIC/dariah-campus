Digitalisation has been one of the most talked about and evolving concepts of the 21st century, with promises of bringing great new solutions to the world. However, the process of digitalisation is quickly becoming one of the biggest offenders against the goal of sustainability. Overtime, several calls from environmental activists as well as nowadays governments have urged the digitalisation experts to think of not only how to improve the world by providing new solutions via Internet and technology, but to consider how this can impact the natural world we live in. As resources are finite and tech-waste comes into play, Daria Gritsenko from University of Helsinki ponders over how to potentially improve sustainability within the area of digitalisation.

Daria Gritsenko is an assistant professor in Russian and Eurasian Studies at the University of Helsinki. Her background in political science and digital humanities, as well as past work in maritime transportation and energy, allows her to explore the effects that politics have on the digital world and vice versa, and how the digital world affects natural resources.
