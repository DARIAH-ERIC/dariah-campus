summary:
  content: Martin Lhoták first began digital research in an IT department, which
    formed his connection with information systems and databases, as well as the
    development of software tools and the digital humanities. Unlike many
    librarians, he does not have a humanist background, but instead a technical
    education, so finds that he speaks differently from the humanities scholars
    he works with. However he finds interactions with these scholars interesting
    and inspiring. Regarding training, he argues that being technically
    knowledgeable - though not necessarily a programmer themselves - is
    essential for doing research in the digital humanities.

Martin Lhoták first began digital research in an IT department, which formed his connection with information systems and databases, as well as the development of software tools and the digital humanities. Unlike many librarians, he does not have a humanist background, but instead a technical education, so finds that he speaks differently from the humanities scholars he works with. However he finds interactions with these scholars interesting and inspiring. Regarding training, he argues that being technically knowledgeable - though not necessarily a programmer themselves - is essential for doing research in the digital humanities.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
