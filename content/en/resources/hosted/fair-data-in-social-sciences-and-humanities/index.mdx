This webinar is part of the TRIPLE Open Science Training Series.

The training session is dedicated to FAIR Data in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and is held by Elena Giglia, Head of the Open Access Office at the University of Turin and member of the Executive Assembly of OPERAS.

Elena Giglia first casts light on what is meant when talking about data in the SSH field. She provides an overview of the FAIR principles and presents many helpful tools for researchers to make their data FAIR. Finally, she introduces the responsible management of FAIR data and how this good practice should be reflected in the Data Management Plan.
