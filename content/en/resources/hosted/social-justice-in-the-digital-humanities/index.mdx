    The Genesis of This Course
  </PageTitle>

  <PageContent>
    This course was envisioned and developed under the aegis of two working groups of DARIAH (The Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities): #dariahTeach and Ethics and Legality in the Digital Arts and Humanities. It was funded by a DARIAH Working Group grant.

    This course is a testament to the socially-engaged and politically-aware digital scholarship happening around the world led by researchers and within heritage institutions. It is edited and managed by Susan Schreibman, and co-edited by Koraljka Kuzman Šlogar, Marianne Ping Huang, and Walter Scholger. Research assistants are Felix Bui, Sina Krottmaier, Ella van Geuns, and Anna Villarica.

    Envisioned as a community-driven course, the majority of case studies have been authored by those who envisioned, developed, and manage the amazing projects working at the intersections of social justice and the digital. A number of case studies have been developed by those working on the Social Justice and the Digital Humanities course.

    This course will never be complete. We acknowledge our biases in reaching out to prospective case study authors, and we very much welcome new case studies. If you have a project that you would like to feature in this course, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) and one of our team will respond as soon as possible.

    Teaching and Learning Methods
  </PageTitle>

  <PageContent>
    This Course consists of a variety of learning modalities that gathers case studies on the topic, broadly conceived, of social justice and the digital humanities. Each of the three case study units are introduced theoretically and are followed by a number of case studies. The fourth unit is a toolbox in which we have gathered a number of tools and protocols to assist those who would like to embed social justice conceptually and practically into their digital research or exhibition design.

    The course consists of text, videos, and interactive elements, and extensive further reading. Some case studies provide exercises which can be done individually or as part of a class. No additional software is needed to take this course. It is delivered asynchronously, with no beginning and end date. As such, it is always available.

      Background

      The notion of justice is inextricably bound up with the idea of ‘fairness’. Of course, much depends then on what we think is fair. For ancient Greek philosophers, justice was about ‘giving each what they deserve’. But this simple pronouncement conjures up a host of questions: What is it that each deserves? Is everybody equally deserving or are there some who deserve more, or less, than others? Should everybody get exactly the same, no matter who they are or what they do, or should we distribute according to people’s capacities, merit, character…? And importantly, who gets to decide on that?

      When specifying his idea of justice, Plato argued that the just state is one in which each person should take on the role that fits them best. This meant that a person excelling in thinking should become a philosopher but also that a person deemed fit to be a carpenter should never aspire to become a statesman… Aristotle added an element of merit: he argued that each should be rewarded according to their inner virtues. But since he believed that not everybody was as well equipped to develop high moral virtues, this also meant that women or slaves – whom Aristotle deemed less able to achieve virtuous conduct – should submit themselves to those having better chances to become good citizens: aristocratic men.

      Nowadays, we would find such arrangements rather unjust. To avoid such issues, modern understandings of justice have emphasized the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. Enlightenment philosophers like Kant, liberal philosophers like J.S. Mill, and more recently John Rawls for example, all centralize the autonomous individual, equal to other such individuals in their capacity for reason and therefore, all equally deserving of rights conferred by the state. Rawls famously argued that rules for fairly distributing rights and resources should be drafted under a ‘veil of ignorance’, in order to eliminate any bias we might have when deciding who gets what. However, as early as the 18th century, critical thinkers like Mary Wollstonecraft and Toussaint Louverture pointed out how certain categories of people – like women, Black people, but also children, the mentally ill or the disabled – were systematically excluded from the ideal of the ‘reasonable individual’, thereby reproducing social inequalities and perpetuating injustice.

      Modern understandings of social justice emerged in the course of the 19th century. Processes of industrialization produced blatant inequalities between the capitalist owners of production and their employees, whose labor they extracted. Under pressure from labor unions and activists, Western liberal states started to take the notion of fairness more seriously, and social justice became a popular notion to justify policies that intervened in the relationship between capital and labor in order to redistribute resources more fairly (Kalsem & Williams, 2010)

      Nevertheless, critical scholarship - like Marxism, the Frankfurt school, different strands of feminist and postmodern thought remained wary of liberal understandings of justice. They took much issue with the individualist logic permeating liberal, and more recently neoliberal and meritocratic ideologies, which tend to hold the individual itself responsible for problems like poverty. Instead, critical theorists developed understandings of social justice that emphasized the structural nature of oppression and discrimination, and argued that such inequalities deeply structure the institutions and social relations of contemporary societies. Demands for social justice then, can be seen as responses to the perceived inadequacies of liberal justice (Barry, 2005).

      Social justice scholarship and activism not only takes issue with the idea of the assumedly disembodied, mutually exchangeable, rights-bearing citizen-subject that infuses liberal thinking on justice and freedom. They also challenge the assumption that the state acts in a neutral and disinterested way when conferring rights and distributing resources. Therefore, it remains important to critically engage with notions of ‘fairness for all’, in order to develop more just frameworks for transforming society and fairly allocating resources and rights to its citizens (Kalsem & Williams, 2010, p. 151).

      ##### Feminism, Intersectionality and Social Justice

      Feminist scholarship and activism in particular have been at the forefront when grappling with the conundrums of 'difference' and the pernicious effects of inequalities, even within movements who explicitly aim to realize more just societies. Feminist movements inspired by social justice denounce how an excessive focus on individual liberty may result in a lack of recognition of structural oppression and discrimination. Within Western feminist movements, this implied challenging the assumedly universal notion of ‘woman’, as this actually had been modeled upon a white, middle class, heterosexual, able-bodied subject whose needs dominated the feminist agenda and eclipsed the very different backgrounds, needs and experiences of those not conforming to this ideal. Feminist theorizing by women of color, disabled and LGBTQIA+ scholars exposed structural inequalities like white privilege, heterosexism, able-ism, and classism and called for additional strategies to address such inequalities. Social justice then implies attending to difference nad recognizing the internal power inequalities permeating social movements. It also requires permanent critical reflection and action to address the pernicious consequences of identity politics that organizes along single axes of identity (Crenshaw, 1991; hooks, 1981; Moraga & Anzaldúa, 1981).

      <IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROwquxC_Gxc?si=3N_CZhm9IqTfnuI5" title="YouTube video player" />

      *In this video Kimberlé Crenshaw talks about intersectionality and how her thought and activism is guided by social justice.*

      Moreover, social justice is not just a matter of words and commitments; it is a praxis driven by the notion that ‘the personal is political’ and that effective action is needed in order to transform society and people's lives. Gray, Agllias & Davies (2014) identify the following strategies in social justice interventions:

      *An archival or archaeological approach:* Inspired by Foucauldian genealogy, this implies looking to history to understand how structural inequalities have become shaped and how and why they continue to impinge upon contemporary institutions and social orders. It also implies a valorization of ‘subjugated knowledges’ (Collins, 1990): these are the stories and experiences of marginalized groups that were commonly excluded from dominant accounts of history, but that have the potential to alter our ways of understanding society.

      * *An intersectional approach:* Recognizing how multiple forms of oppression - based on gender, ‘race', class, religion, sexuality, age, ability and other relevant categories of identity – interlock to create injustice. Addressing injustice then requires going beyond ‘single-axis’ understandings of identity, and recognizing the intersectional invisibilities that can make such experiences invisible, both in theory and in praxis (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008).
      * *A social action approach*: This implies a commitment to making material changes to people's lives, thereby prioritizing bottom-up strategies in order to ensure that those most affected by injustice, participate in and benefit from interventions.

      ##### Bottom Up Social Justice

      In its emphasis on action, participation, bottom-up strategies and social transformation, social justice values align very well with many of the approaches taken in Digital Humanities scholarship and teaching. Indeed, social justice movements are keen on using methodologies that are participatory, involve the target group in every step of the intervention, and aim to produce durable results that can strengthen marginalized communities.

      For example, participatory action research is a much-appreciated method, involving many of the values and principles shared by social justice movements and user-centred design. The following short video made by the Vera Institute of Justice nicely explains the principles of PAR and how this method was helpful in getting recognition for the needs and experiences of young sex workers.

      The values embedded in much Digital Humanities scholarship has much to offer for movements, scholars and activists centralizing social justice and can be a helpful tool when transforming the ways we organize and do research.

      In 2012 Tara McPherson posed the question ‘Why are the digital humanities so white?’ (MCPherson, 2012). This offhand question in a hallway made during a meeting of Digital Humanists in 2008 gave rise to McPherson’s argument that the desire in the 1960s to ‘control complexity’ (Kernighan, quoted in McPherson, 145), chunking and isolating bits in which the operation of the system is meant to be invisible to the user (McPherson 146), was simultaneously happening in American society itself: moving from overt forms of racism (Whites only signs) to covert forms (such as banking practices that forced people of colour into certain neighbourhoods). McPherson argues that both in society and in computational practices modularity became the norm, segmenting both information and people.

      Over the past few decades, several critics have accused Digital Humanists of operating in a in a theory-free zone (Lieu, 2012, Risam, 2015, Bailey, 2011, Risam, 2018, Ruberg 2018) focusing on methodologies that adopt structures and segmentation without questioning their underlying technical, societal, and cultural assumptions. Lieu posited in 2012 that digital humanities would not find its place at the humanities table as an equal partner in scholarship without it developing reflective practices (not just methodological) in incorporating cultural criticism as an integral part of its practice, creating transformative, political action. A decade later, as the case studies in this #dariahTeach course demonstrate, many digital humanists and heritage professions have taken up this mantle in designing digital scholarship, collections, and courses to expose racial injustices, highlight how systems, from metadata to cataloguing systems, replicate and obfuscate gender categories, make opportunities to create new international partnerships, and how scholars from the Global South are taking back their own histories via publicly available scholarship. These projects embed concepts such as intersectionality, not only in their choice of subject area, but in their underlying infrastructures, to expose how societal and cultural entanglements (such as race, coloniality, and class) re-embed themselves systemically in systems we may, perhaps unconsciously accept, as technologies embedded in systems of universal knowledge, highlighting the reframing by democratising the process of frame setting itself (Adam 2020, p.3). This trajectory is discussed by Angel Nieves in a talk given at Amherst College in 2018, entitled Digital Humanities as Restorative Social Justice.

      <IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_XvlNLr_OU?si=eb8b6lfpO1cL-Y-j" title="YouTube video player" />

      The #dariahTeach course, Introduction to Design Thinking and Maker Culture contains a subsection on making in the humanities for social justice (section 1.1.5). It highlights two case studies. One by Angel Nieves and the other by Jennifer Roberts Smith who discusses the Digital Histories for Oral Reconciliation (DOHR) project that centres on the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. The digital reconstruction of the home was a collaborative endeavour with the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children,  Restorative Inquiry, and the Victims of Institutional Child Exploitation Society (VOICES) (Province of Nova Scotia, 2020) to combine oral history and place-based research (see Llewellyn, K. and Ng-a-Fook 2019) through Virtual Reality. The combination of these methods provided an ideal frame to explore themes of the past, of discrimination, and of social justice, by creating a sense of displacement in which the virtual illustration provides enough illusion of place to allow new questions to be asked. One of the outcomes of the DOHR project, as described in the video below, is to provide a space for students to interrogate gaps in the documentary record to better understand the past, while ensuring that the individuals who suffered in the Home do not re-experience harm

      <IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vc5f0l6TEsM?si=pFNgyBDpsQIErFAu" title="YouTube video player" />

      Risam also addresses this idea of frame setting arguing for Digital Humanities scholarship to be active in the ‘creation of new methods, tools, projects, and platforms’ to attend ‘to gaps within archives by interrogating existing ones and building new ones, considering Indigenous forms of knowledge may be engaged to develop new tools, and seeking the transformative possibilities of technology without ceding to techno-utopianism’ (2018, p.81). A re-representation, if you like. Despite some 30+ years of digital humanities scholarship, much research is still frame setting: developing and combing methods in novel ways, questioning long-established vocabularies, re-framing knowledge and knowledge systems, challenging hierarchies and whose voices get to be heard. At the intersections of social justice and the digital humanities, many developers build into their collection design critical theories and remedial practices with the goal of bringing about social transformation rather than accommodation or incorporation (Ghaddar and Caswell, 2019, 71).

      What typifies the current work at the intersections of social justice and the digital humanities is, in Doran Larson’s words, ‘closing material distances’ through virtual interventions, in broaching walls ‘(material, social, cultural, of prisons, plantations, death camps)’ to expose what lies behind closed doors or is buried in the archives, to make injustice visible, both historically and currently, through the various lenses we utilise as humanities scholars. Some projects do this by foregrounding witness narratives, amplifying their voices through online portals, making their testimony available to wider audiences, while at the same time gathering these testimonies into collections which can speak to the wider systemic injustice (Larson 2021). At the same time, the developers of such collections are aware of the responsibility they have towards the documents in their care and the individuals who created them, of the ethical considerations and possible negative repercussions of developing these collections, weighing values such as privacy vs visibility, openness vs confidentiality (Proferes, 2020), for example in making public ego-documents that may have never been intended for public consumption.

      Perhaps a unifying principle of much digital humanities scholarship falls under the second of Adams’ Dimensions of Human Injustice Framework: ‘Cultural-epistemic injustices which refer to issues of knowledge, questioning what counts as knowledge and whose knowledge counts’  (2020, p.3). Thus archives, projects and collections are created that have as their underlying purpose a reassertion of rights over indigenous knowledge, as exemplified by the The Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the Researcher’s Responsibilities case study, or in the creation of collections that claim and amplify marginalised voices, as in the The American Prison Writing Archive. Other digital scholarship is centred on methods such as counter surveillance and spatial justice, as in the Walking the Archive of District Six case study, or developed through digital activism, as in the case studies documenting the YEG Police Violence Archive or the International Council of Archives: Archives at Risk Project. Other projects preserve, make visible and publicly available the voices and histories of marginalised communities, as in the case study on the Documenting the American South project).

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/unit-1-slider-case-study-678" />

      *Case studies in Unit 1*Visualisations can be used to highlight inequality and past injustices in ways more powerful than the written word, as exemplified by the Investigating Indentured Servitude case study. Digital humanities scholarship can be leveraged as a corrective to existing knowledge information systems, metadata, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies that replicate historical biases, as in the case studies QUEERLIT database: Metadata Development and Searchability for LGBTQI Literary Heritage project or The SCWAReD Projects). Digital Scholarship can promote access and inclusion, documented by the Digital Humanities Cooperation between Belgium and the Philippines project), expose historic wrongs, as in the case study on the The Rijksmuseum Slavery Exhibition). Digital Social Justice projects can capture and document the process of societal change, as in the The Digital Repository of Ireland’s case study, Reproductive Rights Archive). It can, through critical data studies such as Data Feminism, highlight ways of interrogating issues such as race, gender, sexuality, and class within extant data sets, and providing a framework in the development of new ones.

      In many respects, these projects adopt decolonial frames of reference in dismantling meta-narratives and in exposing, questioning, and offering alternative epistemological and ontological structures within the digital paradigms they work within. As such, this scholarship asks questions such as who generates knowledge and from where? Who preserves culture, and from which political and linguistic perspectives? How do we make visible ‘suffering, oppression, repression, domination and exclusion’? (Ndlovu-Gatsheni) And how do we conduct this scholarship in ethical, transparent, and open ways.

      ##### Introduction

      From a cell in Alabama, Donald Hairgrove writes, “Through silence, isolation, ignorance and indifference ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/15391a8a27651d27709f9d8c9dc4d3dd4bbe6f97-71043.png)society has allowed and even promoted the steady growth of this criminal justice bureaucracy.” Then he lists things he must do to remind himself that he’s still a human being while confined in that state’s notoriously violent facilities. Imprisoned in Indiana, Valjean Royal documented the serial rape she endured as a transgender woman and how she found the strength and resources to resist while maintaining her Christian faith: “I've gained a light of wisdom from the pain of abuse. A light I want to share with others so they can ‘see’ the better choices they can make, even in the dark places.” Georgian Jamil Hayes describes prison units under COVID lockdown, the absence of health care and resulting tensions that lead to “C.O.s shooting inmates with paint ball guns loaded with pepper spray. It’s like a war zone.”

      These writers’ witness is hosted by The American Prison Writing Archive, the first fully searchable digital archive of non-fiction and poetry by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside US prisons and jails today. Initiated in 2009 by Hamilton College literature professor Doran Larson’s call for essays for a book collection, *Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America (2014),* the APWA is the result of incarcerated people continuing to write beyond that book’s deadline. Legally confined writers rushed the gates of analog publication and onto a digital platform, resulting in a living archive of prison witness.

      ##### Rationale for the project

      At just under two million, the people living and working behind bars in the US constitute a major metropolis. This is a prison city not only in sheer numbers but in the coherency of literary witness to the human experience of prison conditions. These writers offer the most extensive corpus of experiential, grounded writing and knowledge about US confinement in our time.

      The APWA secures prison witness’ place in our understanding of the carceral state. Contributions from Rikers Island to San Quentin and everywhere in between have established the APWA as a central hub of prison witness for the academy, journalists, activists, civic leaders, system impacted communities and family members. The APWA is responsive to the needs and ideas and aspirations of both the confined and the families and communities they come from, all newly enabled to see and share the suffering, trials, challenges, and freedom dreams that the mass prison seeks to silence.

      By gathering the human stories emerging from prison facilities across the nation, the American Prison Writing Archive helps us to measure the full human costs of American legal order, placing imprisoned people at the vanguard of mapping the Prison City that anchors and perpetuates both legalized inequality and the carceral state. The digital presence of these authors stands in direct resistance to the centuries-long efforts of prisons and jails to silence their wards. They thus join a 200-plus year canon of testimony from incarcerated Americans testifying to the utter failure of the prison to achieve constructive ends.

      The APWA was initiated, developed and sustained at Hamilton College for over ten years with the support of Hamilton College and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is now housed at Johns Hopkins University and supported by Johns Hopkins and a major grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation. The APWA currently hosts over 3,300 essays, from forty-eight states, over four hundred prison facilities, and includes 1,099 authors. It grows by approximately seventy new works each month. Essays run from one-page cries for help from the unceasing light of isolation cells, to hip-hop inflected shout outs of warning to kids in subjugated communities, to research-based policy critiques, and more.

        The APWA includes non-fiction essays and poems, newsletters, and more.*

      In literary testimony from across the nation, we see the prison population emerge as a nearly inexhaustible resource for first-person reassessment of US criminal legal practices, who they target, and their effects on individuals, families, and communities. The counter-narratives in the APWA open the mass prison to humanist scholars and students, the broad public, lawmakers, and the families of incarcerated people. They breach the “silence, isolation, ignorance and indifference” that, as Donald Hairgrove claims, have entombed a carceral metropolis. The APWA poses a singular opportunity for the legally confined to play a vital role in reshaping collective wisdom about carceral experience.

      The aim of the APWA is to make prison witness widely accessible, so that when scholars, journalists, policymakers and the public discuss incarceration, they must confront the testimony of those inside. With a current word count equivalent to over forty-one percent of all known North American slave narratives, perhaps the most daunting fact about the APWA is that it has been drawn primarily from a single, quarter-page call for essays in the monthly pages of Prison Legal News. The APWA, even at its current rate of growth, is mounting one of the largest bodies of witness literature on earth, thus documenting the tens of thousands of complex, thriving, damaged, yet resistant lives being led in lockups across the US today, and their collective critiques, experiences, and aspirations.

      The APWA has enabled projects that offer unprecedented glimpses into the lived experience of punishment: “The Zo,” from The Marshall Project, presents testimony to the institutionalized disorientation that imprisoned people endure and to their efforts to adapt, respond, and resist; Josefine Zieball’s “Queer and Trans Prison Voices: A Podcast Archive on Prison Abolition” offers the voices of a population living at existential odds with the cultures of the institutions where they are housed; undergraduate and graduate classroom use and theses have illuminated the common narratives that official records obscure; and a network of over two hundred volunteers transcribing hand-written essays and tagging essay contents across four continents—in classrooms, community centers, libraries, and private homes—gives evidence of how the APWA can draw the support of people across borders and demographics.

      <IframeElement w={640} h={385} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE33jJirvk8" title="YouTube video player" />

      *The APWA has provided the basis for other forms of storytelling related to carceral life. The visual storytelling above is one of a series by Molly Crabapple and the late Michael K. Williams for The Marshall Project, "Welcome to the Zo."*

      ##### Why digital humanities

      The APWA is among the increasing number of DH projects that use the digital as a way to challenge social injustice. Prisons are places where social inequalities are both manifest and anchored. People within face abuse and marginalisation, away from the eyes of the wider public. Their stories have largely been told for them - by journalists, researchers, and the legal system, among others. The grassroots, bottom-up ethos of the APWA has bypassed pre-set research or data-gathering agendas, providing an open call for legally confined people to tell the stories they choose to tell. These writers cast off their positions as objects of study and claim the power of narrative witness to their lives, their conditions, and to their essential roles as collective creators of knowledge from inside the grip of the carceral state.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/e81b5544d1d86432cf5534eb0f453c40d396a82c-71045.png)The Archive is guided by the intentions of writers inside carceral institutions. People who have been in or are currently in the prison system contribute as consultants on the project. In addition, the writers themselves provide the contents of the APWA’s metadata. Search fields include the state of origin, keywords, author and date, and are supplemented by author ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and veteran status. The resulting faceted and word searches allow readers to find information quickly. This also allows the diversity of the prison metropolis to be reflected to the reader. A ‘Terminology’ section on the site gives a guide for readers of the meanings of prison-related terms commonly found in the essays, and a ‘Saved selections’ makes it possible for readers to bookmark essays and curate them.

      As seen below, the interface includes the scans of the original submissions next to the text transcripts. These original scans reflect the conditions of composition and hint at the unequal distribution of opportunities in the prison system (Larson, 2021, para. 35). Some submissions were sent as typed documents printed off a computer, while others were written with a pen or pencil, reflecting that while some have access to technology, others do not. Some pieces were also published in newsletters, indicating support and resources outside. These are not enjoyed by all.

      Larson also suggests in a 2021 essay for *Digital Humanities Quarterly* that DH as a methodology can facilitate social justice efforts for people in carceral institutions. He relates questions regarding balancing ‘addressing mass incarceration as a statistical fact - as a data set - and/or as a human and humanly articulated condition experienced and documented as discrete individuals’ (Larson, 2021, para. 4) to the debate between distant reading and close reading as methods. Purely computational approaches may run the risk of reducing the testimony of incarcerated individuals to data points, while close reading an individual piece may fail to reveal the larger context it is part of. Thus, the approach Larson (2021) advocates for reading prison witness content is what he calls **cellular reading**. This is reading at a ‘proximal’ distance (para. 14), the middle range which falls between distant reading and close reading. Each written piece is a cell, like in a body or prison architecture. While each piece is a singular statement, it offers ‘context-dependent representative testimony for a collective body’ (para. 2), each piece stands among ‘witness borne by individual human beings who are also exemplars among a mass population’ (para. 13). Throughout the corpus of prison narratives, common themes are found (See Table 1 below). While these ‘’typical’’ moments across the texts carry authority, at the same time ‘each text remains absolutely authoritative regarding the experience, anger, aspirations, hope or hopelessness of its author’ (para. 14). In other words, while computational analysis makes the discovery of themes easier and may become for readers ‘the basis for focused advocacy’ (para. 22), focused reading is also necessary to get a full sense of the unique lived experiences of individuals.

      ##### From invisibility to visibility

      At the end of her best-selling book, The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander writes, “Isolated victories can be won—even a string of victories—but in the absence of a fundamental shift in public consciousness, the system as a whole will remain intact.” (Alexander, 2010, 234). In 2016, Marie Gottschalk seconded Alexander’s conclusion and underscored the “invisibility of millions” of imprisoned from the public sphere:

      > *The slave narratives of the antebellum period, which graphically rendered the physical pain that slaves suffered and made it widely visible, helped to propel the abolitionist cause. Today, what happens in prison stays mostly in prison, making it harder to draw connections in the public mind between justice on the inside and justice on the outside. The ability to identify with an offender—or not—is a key predictor of why people differ in their levels of punitiveness.(Gottschalk, 2016, 274)*

      The American Prison Writing Archive is an effort to do for incarcerated people what America’s slave narratives did for enslaved people: through representative writers, to dismantle public propaganda about who de-legalized people are, the nature of the regime under which they live, and the disastrous personal, communal, and social effects of this regime. It is an effort to do for those legally confined in the US today what witnesses at truth and reconciliation commissions do for themselves and for future generations: to give faces and voices to those on the receiving end of state-sponsored violence, exploitation, and inequality, and to make evident the irreplaceable human stories that witnesses bring to any thinking or public debate about ways to move forward.

      To enable fundamental change in carceral policies and practices, and to abandon imprisonment as the default answer to poverty, mental illness, and legacies of subjugation, public perceptions of incarcerated people need the kind of transformation that images of the targets of police violence are undergoing today. The writers in the APWA are already evoking such transformation in the minds of students in classrooms from Berkeley to New Haven, from Baltimore to Santa Clara. In Iowa, California, Maryland, Texas, Connecticut, Indiana, Florida, Idaho, and other states, students are working in and for the Archive as well as doing research and writing based on its holdings. The effects of such work can be profound. As one student concludes, “No other group of individuals is more knowledgeable about the realities of incarceration and the toll it imposes.”

      Curating essays is a valuable experience for students, educators, researchers and casual readers of prison witness. In searching and grouping essays thematically, links are drawn between individual testimonies. It is possible to curate a collection for specific themes, or to help tell stories that may be overlooked. Through curated collections, common themes and narratives come to light. For readers of the website, curated collections are another way to locate essays. Use the template below to curate prison witness testimonies as others have done.

      Police violence archives (PVAs) collect, document, and share incidents of police violence through data, stories, and documentation. PVAs document the most egregious accounts of police brutality as well as more routine, daily abuses by police such as illegal searches, harassment, and racial profiling (Berkeley Copwatch 2022). By highlighting less sensational, daily abuses, PVAs demonstrate the pervasive nature of police violence (Berkeley Copwatch 2022) and call attention to larger systemic patterns of violence and oppression (YEG Police Violence Archive 2023).

      *Community Archives*\
      Community archives are grassroots efforts to collect and preserve historical records and cultural heritage. They recognize that traditional, state-mediated archives and cultural institutions have often neglected the experiences and histories of marginalized groups, leading to the erasure of important stories and perspectives. Community archives seek to address this gap by providing a space for underrepresented communities to actively engage in the preservation and sharing of their own histories.

      PVAs founded in community archival practices are tools of community-based accountability that aim to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions. Rooted in BIPOC and LGBTQ2S+-led abolitionist struggles against the police, community-led PVAs share a critical analysis of policing and punishment and recognize that police inherently cause harm to our communities (Drake & Williams, 2017; Stelkia, 2020).

      ##### **The Project: YEG Police Violence Archive**

      <IframeElement w={400} h={225} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmsKE-Rc2rQ?si=A0PESxJCOd1-SjjK" title="YouTube video player" />

      \*Tessa McDougall from the YEG Police Violence Archive explains why it is important to revise incident reports from news and articles.\*The YEG Police Violence Archive was initiated in Edmonton, Canada (part of Treaty 6 territory also known as amiskwacîwâskahikan) in 2020 in response to the public surge in interest in the Defund the Police movement, spearheaded by Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, USA. The project is part of a larger campaign led by the non-profit advocacy organization Sexual Assault Voices of Edmonton (SAVE) aiming to counteract the misconceptions that policing is necessary to protect victims of sexual violence. YEGPVA aims to document incidents of police-perpetrated violence in the Edmonton area to give survivor-victims a space to have their experiences of harm recognized as such and validated, and to put information about the forms and patterns of police violence in the hands of abolitionists. Encompassing a wide range of forms of violence, from police killings and sexual assaults, to ‘starlight rides’ and breaking up encampments of the unhoused, to the use of microaggressions and hostile reporting procedures for gender-based violence, the archive attempts to offer a space to recognize the forms and harms that police violence creates in our society.

      ##### **Theory Into Practice**

      There are many ethical and theoretical pitfalls associated with the documentation of violence towards black and brown bodies in particular, which the YEGPVA team has sought to navigate. Archives replicate the same biases and injustices present in society (Bak et al., 2017; Williams & Drake, 2017). By relying on documents created by the very people who have perpetrated the violence that we are archiving, we risk replicating existing power structures by accepting the narratives presented (Williams & Drake, 2017). While biases exist within the narratives written by law enforcement and related institutions, biases are also present in the silences created by police documentation (Guberek & Hedstrom, 2017).

      Following the work of Berkeley Copwatch’s People’s Database for Community-Based Police Accountability, the YEGPVA employs many archiving practices designed to center accountability and trauma-informed stewardship of knowledge. These practices include data models and custom ontologies that attempt to reframe biased media reporting to a victim-survivor-centered perspective and retain individuals as the owners of knowledge about their own lived experiences. Given that news articles often cite statements from law enforcement, our researchers critically examine where information about incidents comes from and seek out reports that include quotes and first-hand accounts from victim-survivors and their families. When this information is unavailable (which it often is), our researchers “read against the grain” to interrogate and resist replicating dominant narratives of criminality, deviance, and deficit that inform reporting about police violence. Most importantly, YEGPVA is transparent about its archiving practices (and shortcomings) and attempts to draw attention to which voices are absent in a story through details like metadata.

      *Tessa McDougall from YEG Police Violence Archive addresses their editorial policies and ethical considerations.*

      ##### **Language and Reparative Archival Description**

      YEGPVA researchers gather information from a variety of publicly available sources including court proceedings, statements from law enforcement, and news articles to write descriptions of the violence incidents included in the archives. By rewriting descriptions of violence incidents in a way that prioritizes the victim-survivor, we acknowledge the way that police and media narratives are currently used to shift accountability away from the police who perpetrate harm, instead assigning blame to the victim-survivors.

      We implement the following reparative description principles in the writing and editing of YEGPVA records:

      Our language choices aim to reduce harm and be responsive to community needs and represent the way that members of certain communities prefer to be called; however, we recognize that language is fluid and changing and that not all members of a community may identify with the terminology that we have used.

      ##### **Conclusion/Future Work**

      As a project grounded in the community, the YEG Police Violence Archive will continue to evolve and grow to address the wants and needs of community members, and in response to shifts in the ways that policing is practiced. This could include focusing on other pressing policing-related issues in the community, like the involvement of police bodies in the opioid epidemic or in responding to mental health crises. Central to all future work of the project is an ongoing commitment to self-reflection and accountability to the community.

      ##### I. What is SCWAReD?

      The HathiTrust Research Center’s project on Scholar-Curated Worksets for Analysis, Reuse & Dissemination, or![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f480be7dc872d17f44e8cd8b1ff182d016f39a1a-71063.png)SCWAReD (pronounced *squared*), generously supported from 2020 to 2023 by the Mellon Foundation, produced a suite of scholar-curated, targeted worksets of materials from the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL). HTRC worksets are user-created collections of HathiTrust volumes that can be treated as data and analyzed using a variety of tools and services. Worksets can be shared and cited, contributing to research reproducibility and durable scholarship. In addition to their intrinsic value as focused digital collections, SCWAReD’s enhanced, scholar-curated worksets also serve as illustrative, reusable research models and include not only the worksets themselves but also scholarly introductions, derived datasets and related documentation, and research reports, demonstrating the collaborative workset-building, textual analysis, workflow development, and dataset creation activities typically carried out by the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC).

      The special mission of SCWAReD is to highlight and center the work of historically under-resourced and marginalized textual communities. For this purpose, a flagship project and four additional projects were selected; each explores new methods for creating, analyzing, and reusing curated digital library collections and their resulting research data.

      ##### II. The SCWAReD Projects

      ###### Black Book Interactive Project in HathiTrust

      HTRC partnered with SCWAReD co-PI Dr. Maryemma Graham and her team (Jade Harrison, Ashley Simmons, and Brendan Williams-Childs) at the University of Kansas to develop a flagship research model based on the Project on the History of Black Writing (HBW). HBW was founded in 1983 at the University of Mississippi by Dr. Graham and has been hosted since 1998 at the University of Kansas. Its principal activities include the creation of the largest known bibliographic database of African-American literary texts in existence; a robust program of summer institutes for professional development and student engagement; community building; and research publishing. HBW’s more recent project to create and curate digital full-text versions of works documented in the bibliography is subsumed under the Black Book Interactive Project (BBIP). The motivating question for BBIP is this: How well is the largest known bibliography of African-American-authored texts reflected and represented in the largest known academic digital library? With a combination of advanced metadata matching and methods in textual analysis, this SCWAReD flagship project seeks not only to answer this question but also to remediate some of the discovered gaps by seeking sources for as many missing texts as possible, developing new ways of incorporating as many of these into the HathiTrust Digital Library as possible, devising new ways to derive data from those texts that cannot be ingested into HathiTrust, and creating SCWARed worksets and research models from all the diverse sources that we are able to gather.

      ###### Projects selected for SCWAReD-funded Advanced Collaborative Support

      On top of the Black Book Interactive Project, four additional projects were selected through a competitive process to create, document, and analyze the corresponding worksets, in collaboration with HTRC. They are outlined below:

      III. Supporting Diversity in Digital Humanities with Worksets

      The SCWAReD project helps to answer ongoing calls in the digital humanities to diversify both research and dataset production, partially through the emphasis on collaboration, which Isabel Galina Russell has identified as a fruitful avenue “towards achieving a more inclusive and open” digital humanities (2014, p. 315). In addition to Russell, Risam (2015) and Mahony (2018), among many, have called for a shift from the North American, English-centric data and study in digital humanities. Assembling and publishing expert-curated worksets of traditionally marginalized items, along with associated scholarly documentation and general sets of derived data is designed to help inspire both new work in non-traditional research areas of DH as well as help lower the barrier of entry for new scholars to engage in digital humanities research. SCWAReD projects are also designed to serve as a replicable model for meaningful collaboration, especially aimed at including new and non-traditional research and researchers. Prof. Kim Gallon, a SCWAReD project director and prominent voice in Black digital humanities, identifies a new Black digital praxis influenced by the notion of the workset. Key to this praxis are the concepts of community building and participation; recovery and iterative data collection, documentation, and analysis; and viewing the workset as a living product that can support user tags and metadata additions (Gallon, 2021), concepts that are also at the heart of SCWAReD.

      ###### Filling the gaps

      Diverse collaboration can often only take the field so far, as digital humanities research is at the mercy of data quality and availability. Given the legal history of text and data mining (Grimmelmann, 2016) and corresponding digitization policies and initiatives, the search for relevant materials for non-canonical cultural research is often one that ends with empty hands. The SCWAReD project attempts to pilot and examine a workflow for filling gaps in incomplete digital collections–gaps that too often silence voices and perspectives at the periphery. The emphasis on recovering and documenting existing marginalized (or “hidden”) portions of collections implies the discovery and potential remediation of gaps in a digital library collection that hopes to be reasonably comprehensive.

      The causes of neglect and marginalization of certain texts and textual communities are many, beginning with historical injustices related to the social, economic, and cultural conditions in which these texts were first produced, distributed, collected, and preserved \[1]. What we must recognize, and what our project seeks to address, is that such injustices persist in library collections and continue today in our own library practice. The HathiTrust Digital Library is only as complete as the collections of its contributing member libraries, in which historical injustices are of course reflected. At the same time, similar historical injustices have impeded the development of infrastructures required to allow under-resourced non-member libraries (many of which have collections that could indeed fill important gaps) to join HathiTrust and contribute. The SCWAReD project cannot, of course, even begin to address the deepest of these injustices, nor can it remove the barriers to participation in HathiTrust. But what it can do is to identify some of the intellectual consequences of those injustices (“collection gaps,” for want of a better term), and adopt innovative strategies for outreach and engagement in the recovery and inclusion of missing materials through available means \[2]. Below we explore in more detail one of the five SCAReD workset projects, José González’s Worksets for Spanish American Fiction.

      ##### IV. Case Study: Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction \[3].

      ###### Rationale for the project

      While the majority of volumes currently included in the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) are written in English (51.1%), Spanish only accounts for 6.5% of the 17.6+ million current total volumes\[4].*Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction* (directed by Prof. José Eduardo González) aims to create worksets of relevant items available in HTDL - both in and out of copyright - for scholars interested in Spanish-language literature, and in particular Spanish American fiction. Working towards multilingual digital humanities communities, projects, methods and practices has been at the center of several conferences and publications in the past decade. Isabella Galina Russell’s pivotal question “‘who is ‘we’?” (Galina, 2014, p. 307) and her remarks on the general status of digital humanities as “a reflection of the way academia works in general with English as the predominant language and with a few countries having a far larger representation and research output” (Galina, 2014, p. 314) still resonate today, though many efforts have been made since then to promote a more inclusive and multilingual DH \[5].

      An additional goal of González’s project is indeed to incentivise the use of digital and computational methods - and in particular quantitative methods - for the study of Spanish American literature. Lastly, this project will help HathiTrust to identify and potentially rectify gaps in HTDL collections of Spanish American fiction, contributing to a less English-centric and more inclusive HTDL. *Period-Specific Worksets for Spanish American Fiction* includes six worksets, each focusing on different literary periods, genres or styles (To these, a seventh workset of “Unsorted fiction” was compiled in part as a comparative set to use for analysis purposes, and in part as a continued effort to compile and share lists of Spanish American novels available to researchers in the HTDL, classified by country of origin):

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/six-worksets-641" />

      ###### Building worksets

      The six (plus one) scholarly-curated lists of volumes assembled by Prof. González, were used to perform automatic searches of the HTDL. The searching process developed in three main phases: 1) pre-processing to correct errors and normalize data (title/author lists); 2) searching the published HathiFiles (an up-to-date listing of the entire HTDL holdings which includes bibliographic metadata) for matches for each title/author combination from the list provided; 3) reviewing search results to evaluate matches and identify any potential false positives. Searching was done via fuzzy string (text) matching to allow potential variations in spelling of both the title and author names. Around 68.9% of volumes searched were found in the HT digital library, with the following breakdown by genre:

      Analysis results: The case of the Mexican Revolution

      Using the seven worksets described above, Prof. González performed analysis aimed at automatically identifying each of the six genres, using the “Unsorted” list as a comparative set. The initial goal was to apply techniques that had previously been successful at studying and detecting literary genres in English-language worksets to texts written in Spanish and produced in Latin America. This process used a predictive “logistic regression model” trained on examples of each genre and then given unseen samples to classify. Below is a brief description of results related to the Narrative of the Mexican Revolution genre.

      Characteristics of the genre: One of the most successful genres in Latin American literature is a specific narrative that originated in Mexico during the revolution against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz between 1911 and 1921, thereafter labeled as “novel of the Mexican Revolution.” Though critics have long debated whether these novels constituted a “genre”, there are common characteristics that identify this group: common topics related to the revolutionary uprising, and tendency to combine literature, politics and history.

      Analysis results: The analysis was performed in two different batches: volumes published between 1930 and 1950 (Figure 5), and volumes published between 1950 and 1960 (Figure 6).

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/comparison-of-1930s-1950s-to-1950s-1960s-638" />

      *Figures 5-6: Slide to the right to focus on the 1930s-1950 (Figure 5);\
      Slide to the left to compare against 1950s-1960s (Figure 6)*

      As Figure 5 shows, the logistic regression model experienced problems detecting this genre from randomly chosen volumes published between 1930 and 1950. Not only are some of the random volumes considered part of the genre, but also several of the books labeled as novels of the revolution received low predicted probability numbers, potentially undermining the argument for these novels as a distinct genre. This will come as no surprise, especially for those familiar with the history of the Mexican Revolution genre: as González underlines, the high number of noisy labels in the data originate from the fact that many competing literary publications - not easily distinguishable from those considered narratives of the Mexican Revolution - were simultaneously published during those first few decades, speaking perhaps to characteristics of writing of the era rather than the genre.

      Meanwhile, Figure 6 shows that the Mexican revolutionary novel is more easily distinguishable from other products in the Mexican literary field of the 1950s and 1960s. As González underlines in his Report, “this outcome is not simply the result of very few new novels being published in a dying category, but of the nationalistic discourse of the 1930s running its course”.

      The SCWAReD team at the HathiTrust Research Center and the many scholars with whom we are working to developed these curated worksets continue our work and will be releasing additional worksets, data sets, and reports as they become available in the coming months. We hope these five worksets, focused on making available for research volumes relevant to historically under-resourced and marginalized textual communities, will be the first of many and we look forward to partnering with other scholars in the future to continue this work.

      ##### V. Availability

      Access to HathiTrust data through HTRC is informed in part by the concept of *non-consumptive research*. Non-consumptive research simply refers to research that does not involve traditional human reading (or consumption) of the original text and thus does not violate copyright or licensing restrictions. Examples of non-consumptive research include computer processing of texts, such as the generation of word-frequency lists and lists of named entities (e.g, proper nouns).

      Most HathiTrust Research Center tools, datasets, and services are freely available to the worldwide scholarly community. Any user may analyze HathiTrust volumes through the various web-based algorithms available on the HTRC Analytics site. These include our Topic Model Explorer, Named Entity Recognizer, and Token Count and Tag Cloud Creator. These algorithms access the full-text directly on our servers. The results are provided to users but not the raw full-text of the volumes.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7903747c76dac73f4748ec83b28a449998a01711-71066.png)*Figure 7: The interface of the HTRC Analytics web environment*\
      Anyone can access all the derived datasets included in the github repositories for each SCWAReD workset. These include Extracted Features data for the workset, which consists of volume- and page-level metadata and page-level arrays of all the words that occur on the page, with their corresponding part of speech and occurrence counts. These extracted representations of the workset include all the words (or “tokens”) in all its volumes, but since the words don’t appear in their original order they are also *non-consumptive,* and thus open to all.

      The HTRC Data Capsules provide a secure computing environment for researcher-driven text analysis on the HathiTrust corpus. In the data capsule, researchers may download arbitrary software and libraries or run their own code to analyze the full-text files directly. Data capsules with access to in-copyright volume are only available to researchers affiliated with HathiTrust member institutions.

      Lastly, HathiTrust makes available the full-text of all volumes in their Digital Library deemed to be public domain, or not under copyright. A volume’s status as public domain is based on many factors, including the location of the user wishing to access the data. More information about this program and available data can be found on the HathiTrust datasets webpage.

      ##### **Introduction to the *North American Slave Narratives Digital Library***

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5f853685729c815f1ee265a1e9a41724851a8c82-71069.jpg)The great slave narratives of U.S. history and literature provide shocking evidence of the unimaginable depravity of America’s “peculiar institution,” as its defenders termed it. Those same narratives also contain inspiring testimony to the dauntless fortitude and faith of those who endured enslavement, overcame it, and bore witness against it. The most powerful stories in the U.S. slave narrative tradition are invariably the ones that have been verified as true. The fact that they are true, that they hold a mirror to U.S. history in a unique and still compelling way, makes these narratives essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the origins of racism and white supremacy in the United States.

      Narratives of the lives of formerly enslaved people are also the foundation on which African American literature was built. In 1849, the noted white transcendentalist clergyman Theodore Parker stated, “All the original romance of Americans is in them \[the slave narratives], not in the white man’s novel.” While slave narratives dramatized appalling trauma suffered by Black Americans across the United States, North as well as South, many of these narratives also portrayed various forms of resistance to oppression that the enslaved engaged in. The most popular narratives published between 1840 and 1865 focused on the heroic and highly dangerous escapes of fugitive slaves from the South to the North. Fugitive slaves such as Frederick Douglass, William Wells Brown, Henry “Box” Brown, and William and Ellen Craft became internationally celebrated figures whose narratives sold in the tens of thousands in the United States and Great Britain and were translated into other European languages.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/nasn-famous-narratives-619" />

      North American Slave Narratives (NASN) was launched in 1999 with the goal of making the entire corpus of African American slave narratives up to 1920 available to readers around the world. Over the last four decades of the 20th century, the narratives of the famous fugitive slaves of the mid-19th century had gained increasing visibility to scholars and teachers in the United States. However, the large majority of the slave narratives published before the abolition of U.S. slavery in 1865 remained unfamiliar, especially to the American general public, and inaccessible to readers beyond U.S. borders. North American Slave Narratives was designed to represent all the voices of the enslaved that had been preserved in print up to 1865, not just those whose stories had become famous. Another key goal of the project was to ensure that anyone with access to the internet anywhere in the world could read any text in the slave narrative tradition at no charge.

      *The screenshots of the North American Slave Narratives digital librabry.*

      Funded by a substantial grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and supplemented by grants from private funders, NASN was conceived by its Series Editor, William L. Andrews, E. Maynard Adams Distinguished Professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The UNC-CH Library provided funds that supported the work of NASN’s Project Manager, Natalia Smith, and dozens of UNC-CH graduate students who worked with Ms. Smith to ensure that each text underwent rigorous editing, encoding, and review before it was published online. The final report on the project to the NEH in September 2001 noted that 230 slave narratives (35,337 pages) had been placed on the NASN site, including not only autobiographical texts but biographical and fictionalized ones as well. Nowhere else in the world does a digital library of African American life-writing of such breadth and historical import exist for readers worldwide and at no charge to those who read or download materials from the site.

      The editorial philosophy of the project required the texts to be based on scrupulously transcribed digital copies of original editions, many of which were shared with the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by libraries and special collections far and wide. Because many of the original editions of the narratives are unavailable to readers today, when possible the transcribed and digitized texts of these narratives are accompanied by reproductions of visual images included in the original texts, as well as reproductions of the front and back matter (including any author portrait that appeared as a frontispiece for a slave narrative). In some cases, the front and back covers as well as the spine of a slave narrative published as a cloth-bound book also appear in NASN. Various additional explanatory materials, such as summaries of texts and other writings published by or about the narrators themselves, are linked to many texts in NASN. In addition, the site features a bibliography of all the narratives on the site in alphabetized and chronological listings as well as a compact introduction to the history, influences, and import of slave narratives to U.S. as well as African American history, literature, and culture. An example of one of the illustrated books is below.

      North American Slave Narratives received designation from the Southeastern (U.S.) Library Network as an Outstanding Library Program in 2000. It has been reviewed or cited positively in scholarly journals such as *Library Journal* and *Higher Education* and praised in articles released by the Associated Press and in newspapers such as the *Washington Post*. The site has grown to 294 texts, in a few cases because of the addition of texts, hitherto unknown to scholars, that were contributed to NASN by descendants of the narrators of these exceedingly rare texts. Over the past five years (April 2018 – April 2023) NASN has amassed 5,432,608 page views, an average of over 1 million visits to the site annually.

      *An interview with the late Dr. Jean Fagan Yellin on Harriet Jacobs' life. Dr. Yellin is known for her research on Harriet Jacobs' authorship of the first published female slave narrative.*

      Before 1865 slave narratives by and about Black males vastly outnumber those by or about Black females. By far the most influential pre-1865 female-authored slave narratives was and still is Harriet Jacobs’s *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl* (1861), which depicts the author’s resistance to her enslaver’s sexual exploitation and her ultimate achievement of freedom for herself and her two children. However, in many narratives by males Black women in bondage are portrayed as pitiable victims, in an attempt to highlight, as Jacobs put it, the many ways in which “Slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more terrible for women.”

      However, images of Black women in slave narratives are not limited to those of tragic victims. Consider two enslaved women who appear in Douglass’s *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* (1845) and his second autobiography, *My Bondage and My Freedom* (1855). The first chapter of the *Narrative* contains a horrific account of the whipping of Douglass’s aunt Hester, which the author witnessed as a child. Compare the depiction of Hester in 1845 to Douglass’s boyhood memory of Nelly, an enslaved mother whose “impudence” to a cruel overseer touched off a hand-to-hand fight between the two (*My Bondage and My Freedom*, chapter VI). Notice the reactions Douglass attributes to each woman during and after the whippings they received. Nelly does not appear in Douglass’s *Narrative* of 1845. But in 1855 Douglass told her story only a few pages after recounting the whipping of his aunt. What might account for these differences between Douglass’s two autobiographies?

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f7a8bd9f703314d033644c50e01c5f2715e6bac5-71075.png)The pedagogic intersections between social justice and digital humanities is a relatively recent phenomenon, even within the relatively young field of digital humanities. The examples we found are less plentiful than, for example, courses that focus on an introduction to the field or on a specific methodology. Nevertheless, since c. 2015, there has been an increasing number of courses that specifically target the intersection of these two spaces, theoretically and methodologically, typically taking a praxis-based approach to learning and teaching. Some of these courses rethink how students are assessed and engaged, for example, through syllabi that encourage student-led projects focusing on social impact, exposing inequalities or societal injustices (a gathering of these can be found at the FemTechNet Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Pedagogy Workbook, pictured on the right). There are also several sites that amalgamate or create resources, including Teaching and the Digital Humanities (2015) and Digital Humanities for Social Justice (2023), as well as this course, for instructors who would like to incorporate exercises, assessments, and/or readings at the intersections of social justice and digital pedagogy.

      This introductory page is divided into three sections. Section I provides examples of DH courses within a methodological and theoretical framework. In section II we highlight several digitally-inflected project-based assessments. Section III provides a list of resources for instructors wishing to incorporate social justice themes into their Digital Humanities teaching.

      ##### I. Methods and Theories

      Digital Humanities is one of many fields in which instructors have begun to take an intentional approach in integrating social justice themes into their methodological practice. In his 2020 article ‘Between Social Justice and Decolonisation: Exploring South African MOOC Designers: Conceptualisations and Approaches to Addressing Injustices’ Taskeen Adam provides a framework for three lenses for what he terms *Dimensions of Human Injustice.* These lenses, e.g., material, cultural-epistemic, and political/geopolitical, provide a framing that instructors adopt, depending on their own positionality, educational goals, and methodologies chosen. These lenses also play a part in the instructor’s own views on how society shapes the ‘ways in which they understand and approach student difference and disadvantage’ (Keddie 2012: 264). Central to course design is about choosing the best methodology(ies) to address specific injustice(s):

      > ...some placing greater emphasis on cultural-epistemic injustices embedded in geopolitical inequalities, and others on material injustices that need addressing at societal and national levels. This approach assists in putting aside narrow interpretations of particular discourses, for example, social justice being equated to economic justice, or decolonial movements being interpreted as Africanisation, towards a more holistic mindset that can better tackle the multiple dimensions of injustice in our educational contexts and bring about learning designs that better support learners (Adam 2020:2).

      DH instructional design is an extremely good fit for raising student awareness of societal injustice, inequalities, and privilege, as the praxis-and team-based approach of many DH courses provide opportunities for truly transformative education, informed by context, the ‘situatedness of knowledge, and the necessity for education to respond to the needs of that context’ (Nnenne as quoted in Adam 2020: 7). DH courses can demonstrate to students the inclusivity of making visible issues such as dismantling power relations, social hierarchies and cultural hegemonies via public-facing assignments (Luckett and Shay, 2017: 3).

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/72752965c64c4a86a977a575266279b4c3a689c4-71076.png)*Watch here a presentation on challenges\
      of DH teaching (Carnes and Smith, 2022)*

      Digital Humanities pedagogy is not only relevant at the university level. Educational institutions, at both the university and secondary school levels, in St Louis, Missouri, have formed a consortium funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. This is a network for supporting and disseminating methods in digital humanities pedagogy. The goal of the network is to not only bridge the K-12-college divide, but advance digital humanities pedagogy and access for underserved populations, with a focus on student learning.

      This focus is key, particularly at institutions in which students, ‘especially those from poorer or more marginalized backgrounds, miss out on learning the valuable, 21st-century skills that DH can train them in’. Their white paper (Carnes and Smith, 2022) and presentation outline the difficulties of integrating DH teaching and learning at institutions that do not necessarily have the staff trained in DH methods, nor the resources, to engage in praxis-based teaching. The consortium-based approach was taken to expand access, narrowing the inequality gap.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8f5113a080c9ad819c27e8c60acae53900c889ed-71077.png)Another area of DH pedagogy beyond university level, is peer-to-peer training outside of formal curricula. In recent years, workshop designers have been embedding, beyond DH theories and methods, a third pillar into their training: that of social justice. The 2023 open access edited collection *Digital Humanities Workshops: Lessons Learned*\*,\* pictured on the right, demonstrates how important professional DH training beyond the Global North in building local expertise and networks (for example, in chapters on the Indian, African, and Taiwainese experience), but also how to build into one’s curriculum design (no matter where one teaches) social justice concerns, as in Kush Patel, Ashley Caranto Morford, and Arun Jacob’s chapter on ‘Workshops in Anti-Colonial Digital Humanities Towards Building Relationships With Critical University and Community Movements’ (whose work also features as a case study in this unit).

      Here we highlight several courses, at the undergraduate, MA, and professional levels, that embed in their instructional design, a number of the aforementioned theoretical approaches. These, at the time of writing, have syllabi or another format of online presence. Courses are presented from the most recent to the oldest. The majority are from North America as these institutions most frequently tend to make syllabi available online. We acknowledge that this list is incomplete and would very much welcome further examples. If you have a course you would like us to feature, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) with course details providing the information below. If there is no additional information available online, you can send us a PDF of the syllabi, and we can upload it into the #dariahTeach database.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/courses-642" />

      ##### II. Project-based teaching

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b6f429dd0467d8548dd54f3aa1c38f3e53fa4117-71078.png)As mentioned above, many courses utilise project-based assessments. Here we drill down into how some instructors have taken a praxis-based approach. As was the case with syllabi, this is only a very small sample of project-based assessments. If you would like your project-based assessment listed here, please email [socialjusticeDT@gmail.com](mailto:socialjusticeDT@gmail.com) with information similar to what is below. We welcome contributions from conference or symposium panels and instructors. If there is no additional information available online, you can send us a PDF of the or conference abstract syllabi, and we can upload it into the #dariahTeach database.

      A good place to start with project-based assessments at the intersections of social justice and the DH is the 2015 panel on *Teaching and the Digital Humanities* held at Emory University. Panel participants stressed the importance of projects that encourage students to critically engage with digital tools while producing work that is relevant to their communities, providing opportunities for students to be critical, not only of the digital tools and methods they employ, but the communities in which they live and work. An example of this is Anne Cong-Huyen’s course at UCLA in which she guided her students in creating an open-access digital book in Scalar entitled *Ethnic Los Angeles* (pictured on the left and published in 2014). Students conducted research by immersing themselves in communities they would not have normally visited and reflected on the politics of publishing as they were producing the book. Ultimately, the book revealed the racial and ethnic tensions in Los Angeles, allowing students to write an alternative representation of their city. Cong-Huyen remarks:

      > It was proof that undergraduate students can do high-level, original scholarly research if we provide them with innovative, interdisciplinary digital methodologies and analytic frameworks.(Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015)

      At the same symposium, William G. Thomas III, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, described how he encourages students to engage in projects that are publicly available on the [WWW](http://WWW). These allow students to reflect on the affordances available, becoming ‘producers working in a critical fashion with an in the digital medium’. He cited a few examples from his teaching, including student contributions to established projects like The Valley of the Shadow (University of Virginia) and History Harvest (University of Nebraska-Lincoln).

      *![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/596a1a3767d5c17ab0761644f5aef8304e3f9c1a-71079.png)The Valley of the Shadows* project is a digital archive of primary sources from people from Virginia and Pennysylvannia who experienced the American Civil War. In teams, undergraduate students contributed new content to add to the archive. In one instance, a sub-project on US coloured troops became so popular it received emails from the public, and the student team continued to manage the site and engage with the public years later. *History Harvest*, on the other hand, is a collaborative project where students themselves make history by creating digital resources documenting the history of their communities. In creating this digital archive, students engage community members in sharing their stories and artefacts, ultimately to ‘create the possibility and digital space for a more diverse, inclusive, and democratic narrative of American history’ (*Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015*). According to Thomas III, such projects become:

      > a kind of transitional, porous engagement in which students long after remained responsible for and committed to an ongoing interactive engagement in the digital medium. (Teaching and the Digital Humanities, 2015)

      Another example of praxis-based pedagogy centres on community engagement and collaboration, which is central to UCLA’s Data Justice Scholars program. This program is open to UCLA juniors and seniors from all disciplines. Beyond reading courses on the social justice implications of working with data (this year, “Whose Lives Count?: Race, Gender, and Data” and another related course of their choosing), students also conduct data-based research that impacts their community. This gives them a chance to work with LA community partners and apply what they learned in a real life context. The current cohort of students will present their research in the 2024 spring Undergraduate Research week. The scholars also help enhance the Los Angeles Data Justice Hub, an online educational resource featuring resources on how to use, analyse and present data for data justice projects, curated open datasets and project samples.

      Apart from the larger projects mentioned above, there are examples of students engaging in smaller-scale research. This is being done for example at the Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies (GWSS) division at the University of Minnesota, which uses ‘academic technologies for feminist pedagogies and to situate the digital turn in higher education for the purposes of social change’ (‘Digital humanities for Social Justice’, 2023). Students produce media that engage core concepts in their programmes and contribute to social change. Among them are documentaries, digital essays and interactive maps (see examples below). Through such projects, students not only think critically about media and digital tools, but also reflect on how to apply their technical skills to create change-making media.

      ##### III. Resources

      For educators who would like to integrate social justice pedagogy into their DH teaching (or conversely integrate digital methods into explorations of social justice issues), there are a number of resources available which we list here:

      * Creative and Critical Precepts of Critical DH: This guide, started by Roopika Risam, micha cardenas, and participants of the 2015 HILT conference, is useful for DH projects committed to social justice. Questions around *access*\*,\* *materiality*\*,\* *method*\*, and\* *ontology and epistemology* are useful in getting participants/students to reflect and make sure inequalities or injustice are not reproduced when engaging in such projects. The resource also includes examples of social justice DH projects.

      * Data Feminism: This book by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein outlines 7 principles drawn from intersectional feminism to keep in mind when working with data. (Add link to Data Feminism case study; also an image with the 7 principles)

      * Social Justice in the Digital Humanities course, #dariahTeach: This open educational resource explores how digital humanists are intervening in issues of social justice in research and teaching, as well as issues to be considered when developing DH projects with a social justice theme. Some of our featured case studies also include exercises that can be integrated into class (e.g. link and link).

      * Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: an MLA sponsored collection of resources for digital pedagogy in the humanities, with particular themes, including social justice, access, diaspora, gender, digital divides, indigenous, intersectionality, queer, sexuality curated by scholars. Each keyword contains ten ‘artefacts’ - useful resources for teaching that topic - and a curatorial statement. These resources are reusable and re-mixable, and users can curate their own collections.

      * FemTechNet: a digital pedagogical workbook developed by the FemTechNet network for ‘overburdened teachers’ teaching Critical Race and Ethnic Studies in our information culture. This comprehensive living document includes a syllabus, readings, multimedia, sample learning activities and assignments (like this - maybe add as an image/thumbnail one of them), and examples of community-based projects. It is continually being improved by the contributors.

      * Los Angeles Data Justice Hub – UCLA Community Engagement: Described as “a pedagogical tool to empower students, community organisations, and faculty to use data to rectify harm and access open data”, this online resource contains tutorials for educators and students on how to access and use open source data, perform basic analysis and how to produce visualisations for social justice projects (Data Training and Education). There are also open source datasets, mostly focused on the USA and California (Data and Dashboards), as well as Recommended Readings on data justice. Student-led data projects related to LA social justice issues will be featured later in a gallery.

      * San Diego State University Library’s Listing of Digital Humanities Tools. Quite a number of the resources listed here involve Social Justice themes, including Digital Literacy Against Digital Violence: A Handbook for Library Workers, the EDI Toolkit for Digital Scholarship, and SAFElab @ Columbia University. The university also has a TeachDH portal which was established to help faculty teach during and beyond the quarantine. One of the subsections of this portal focuses on Social Justice & Activism which contains resources, projects and sample lessons to help students use DH to think critically about the digital and make a difference. There is also a page for digital tools that can be incorporated into classes or used in those change-making student projects (including comprehensive guides for each).

      * SaturdaySchool Social Justice Teach-In Guide: A guide for teachers who would like to engage students on social media platforms created by Professor Rhonda Ragsdale of Lonestar College. She engages students through #SaturdaySchool on Twitter (now X), writing about particular social justice issues and encouraging students - and the public - to join in the discussion.

Our collective contends with questions of colonial histories embedded within the historically white, upper caste, and resource-rich classroom environments as well as the often unexamined genealogies of commonplace digital tools used in DH research and teaching for digital storytelling, online public writing, and community archiving. We also structure our work around the material and infrastructural realities of educational care work (Friend, 2021), highlighting and challenging the post-secondary institution’s increased adoption of digital surveillance technologies in classroom building, and its ongoingly neoliberal metrics of digital scholarship productivity and promotion. In each of these ways, and following Paulo Freire’s writings on the Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Freire et al., 2009), we cite the knowledge of our collaborators and those of community intellectuals and wider scholars to “unveil” the interrelationships of oppression between digital and analog worlds (Morford, Jacob, and Patel, 2021).

      ##### Why anti-colonial?

      We are intentional in our choice of the word “anti-colonial” in our collective and praxis. Anti-colonial spaces seek to name, confront, contend with, and, as the “anti-” in anti-colonial elucidates, to challenge and resist the ongoing legacies of colonialism, and yet, these spaces are not necessarily the same as decolonizing or decolonial spaces. While the terms “decolonize” and “decolonial” get used repeatedly within post-secondary spaces at the moment, we remain skeptical about the ability of these institutions — built on and entangled in legacies of white supremacy, casteism, classism, ableism, sexism, cisheteropatriarchy, anti-Blackness, and settler colonialism — to truly participate in decolonizing and decolonial processes, which, as the “de-” in the words suggests, undo colonialism. Further, as educators and organizers like Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang remind us, decolonization must center concrete, tangible, material restitution of lands and life to and for Black and Indigenous peoples (Tuck & Yang, 2012). We align with the assertion by bell hooks that classrooms can be radically transformative spaces for social justice learning and organizing and for resistance to the status quo (hooks, 1994). We attempt to foster learning spaces and practices that are accountable to, that contend with and resist ongoing colonial processes, and that imagine relational otherwise against and beyond the current status quo (Patel, Moford, and Jacob, 2023). But we recognize that our current positionings within post-secondary institutions limit and arguably render impossible our ability to craft truly decolonizing spaces and processes at this time, and, thus, we use the word anti-colonial. For more on the nuanced distinctions between decolonial, decolonizing, and anti-colonial concepts and processes, we recommend the work of Lydia Ayame Hiraide (2021) and Gail Omvedt (2011).

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/04f2f43e2f4b17f0633bba658faf74a73327bf47-71091.jpg)*Lydia Ayame Hiraide explains the distinction between 'anti-colonial' and 'decolonial' in her work*\
      *“Postcolonial, Decolonial, Anticolonial: Does it Matter?”.*

      ##### What about infrastructure?

      We align with Susan Leigh Star’s idea of infrastructure as not merely being limited to the technical but, rather, as being relational, land-based, corporeal, human, and, thus as interwoven, rooted, embodied, and living sociotechnical ecologies, acknowledging the relations and locations of power among people, in online and digital spaces, and on/to land (Star, 1999). We must be mindful of how it is that infrastructures are not always-already technologically efficient. Rather, technical infrastructures impede the social, material, structural, and embodied cultural experiences of people who are dis/articulated from mainstream society vis-a-vis the installation and implementation of infrastructural affordances (Costanza-Chock, 2020). Jean-Christophe Plantin and Aswin Punathambekar rightly point out how we are living through the infrastructuralization of digital platforms, and how a critical infrastructural lens enables us to think through and about digital platforms vis-a-vis questions of scale, labor, and cultural practices, policies and regulations (Plantin & Punathambekar, 2019). This is to say, how is it that the pace of digital humanities course adoption in institutional settings is thought through more carefully, wherein the labourers who toil in digital humanities labs and centres are not left in precarious conditions. And in the clamour to build cultural records involving archival works, digitization projects, and community-centered learning, we must be mindful of what sort of harms are replicated as more and more computational efforts and large language models trod through these cultural records.

      The online instructional infrastructures that we labour in/under make clear how it is that teaching in this mediated space is not just simply about delivering content over “wires and lights in a box” (Murrow, 1958). There are technodeterminist implications to this move, the ideological temperament that the instructors themselves must espouse both within and across geographical specificities. As an online instructor, one does not merely perform the pedagogical tasks, being a content matter expert, mentor, coach, and so on. Here one takes on the added responsibilities of being a commercial content moderator (CCM) when using chat rooms, discussion boards, or video conferencing software; a podcaster and/or vlogger, if one produces asynchronous teaching and learning material using audio-video technologies; a virtual help desk to help students navigate instructional software issues and on occasion deal with student hardware and software issues; and even moonlight as an instructional designer to ensure that the course design meets universal design for learning principles. As an online instructor, one is expected to walk into the job having all these competencies, fluencies, and literacies, that is, they are expected to be reified into the infrastructures of subjectivation and responsibilization.

      ##### Pedagogy matters!

      The following three teaching engagements from ***Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed*** form a case study that calls on researchers and educators to consider the possibilities of working at the intersections of digital humanities and anti-colonialism. As you move through the various parts of this case study, you will engage with guidelines for ongoing community building that also outline our orientations to infrastructures that run through, alongside, or even beyond the educational institutions we inhabit. This case study introduces anti-colonial digital humanities accountabilities, histories, perspectives, and methods, reflecting particularly on how to practice digital pedagogies committed to anti-colonialism. We present and invite you to spend careful and care-filled time with these three contexts of our work, each connected to a) furthering digital conscientization; b) practicing care work; and c) reimagining process as product in DH classrooms.

      ###### ##### Introduction: A defiant presence on the page

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/896c31b5aba9952c5e0565b51fb794ecf714cb27-71101.jpeg)It's unusual to be able to encounter a manuscript or even a digital photo facsimile of one unless you're a specialist yourself or know your way to finding them. Looking at those papers can make the past seem to come alive as if you're meeting someone in person, through the distinct marks of their hand on paper. We have a course in my program titled Text Encoding, a method used to remediate manuscript or published text into machine readable format for online presentation and searching, designed to introduce students to writing a kind of code that models information structures in documents of many forms, including manuscripts. In the late months of 2020 as my Text Encoding class struggled with multiple modes of virtual and physical class presence, we also found ourselves in the virtual, mediated presence of a remarkable Black woman activist. We witnessed this activist writing in, around, and against the lines of a survey form, a lively voice of retort against the printed lines on the pages. Anna Julia Cooper, the fourth Black woman from the United States to earn a PhD, and later the principal of the famous M Street high school for Blacks in Washington D.C, helped to introduce my students to manuscripts and why we want to spend time reading and researching them. These were the months following a summer of social justice activism after the killing of George Floyd, and somehow it mattered for us to meet Anna Julia Cooper just then and to witness her writing defiantly against imposed forms.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/96fa8a9f3e7c2e103d02a546046d614e9371c099-71095.jpeg)*Figure 1: Anna Julia Cooper: Educator, Writer and Intellectual*\

      By 2021, Cooper's responses to an occupational survey of Black college graduates became the work of a digital scholarly edition we created that fall, guided by me and led by my student Alice Rong. I like to think the work we did together that year celebrates something vitally important to Cooper herself: the connection of educated colleagues and the formation of communities of teachers and students.

      My students and I knew very little about Anna Julia Cooper when we started this project. We came to know her thanks to a generous introduction and a kind invitation from Shirley Moody-Turner, Director of the Center for Black Digital Research at Penn State University. Dr. Moody-Turner has been researching, locating, and engaging people with early 20th-century Black women activists and is an expert on Cooper, having helped to digitize her papers at Howard University, having edited those papers in The Portable Anna Julia Cooper, and having been working on a forthcoming biography of Cooper. Moody-Turner shared some resources and suggestions for my students to try encoding Cooper's writings, but one topic stood out as a fascinating challenge: What could we do with Cooper's lengthy and intricate responses to a survey of Black college graduates in 1930?

      The writing seemed to rebel against the survey's tidy lineation for short replies. One response to question 65, "Have you a 'racial philosophy' that can be briefly stated?" was later excerpted by Cooper scholars as an essay in its own right, printed in The Voice of Anna Julia Cooper (1998) and most recently in The Portable Anna Julia Cooper, where Moody-Turner describes the the way it was written: "In her handwritten responses, Cooper's writing loops around the typed text of the questions and continues into the margins and onto the back of the pages" (516).

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ethical-lens-4-672" />

      *Figure 2: The hotspots above reveal the journey from handwritten text to the digitised version: from the original version on the top left, the encoding on the bottom left, and the display version on the right.*

      When Dr. Moody-Turner showed the survey to me, she shared the difficulty of processing crowd-sourced transcription of a typewritten form with handwriting that exceeded all bounds. While crowd-sourced transcription through interfaces like Zooniverse works typically with small frames of text on the photo facsimile page, it does not help with following handwriting that moves out of narrow page bounds. We recognized this as a challenge well suited for text encoding, where we could mark and organize answers with questions, following those answers as they traveled over many pages. I am grateful to Moody-Turner for guiding us to one of the most important, relevant documents we could possibly share with a university undergraduate class for their first sustained encounter with manuscripts. We were privileged to witness a defiant and courageous act of writing against the grain of a printed page.

      ##### Anna Julia Cooper and the Survey of Black College Graduates in 1930

      The defiant voice we encountered seems woven into the daring professional person of Anna Julia Cooper. The fourth Black woman from the United States to earn a PhD, Cooper earned her doctorate in 1925 at the Sorbonne in Paris in a moment when she was very much at odds with the prevailing infrastructure for Black education in the U.S. She had been principal of the famous M Street high school for Blacks in Washington D.C., yet at the time she set off to complete her doctorate in Black revolutionary history she had been fired from her post for seeking to establish college preparatory coursework and for advocating the same curriculum for all students (Moody-Turner xxv-xxviii). Cooper and her peers were being pressured to institute a less ambitious curriculum limiting Blacks to segregated vocational roles, but Cooper resisted compromising. She had consistently pressed for change throughout her own schooling, asserting that she should be able to learn the same elite coursework limited to white men during her time as a university student at Oberlin in the 1880s.

      At Oberlin College, one of the progressive Seven Sisters Colleges in Ohio open to men and women of color, Cooper earned an undergraduate bachelor's degree in 1884 and a master's in mathematics in 1887. Protesting segregation and containment seems woven into a life of advocacy for unlimited education, most famously articulated in her book, A Voice from the South, by a Black Woman of the South (1892). That book makes a provocative statement, that educated Black women must lead progressive reform for Blacks and women alike. Cooper's work as an educator is repeatedly marked by acts and bold statements that she herself described as "courageous revolt," a revolt that succeeded in sending her students to elite universities (Moody-Turner, Portable xxvi - xxvii). Cooper dedicated her life to finding pathways for people to succeed in a position to think independently and ambitiously, and that dedication is evident in the remarkable responses she wrote on the survey she received in 1930, headed "Negro College Graduates: Individual Occupational History."

      The author of the survey project was Charles Spurgeon Johnson, who was born in 1893, a year after Anna Julia Cooper published her Voice from the South. Educated in the 1920s as sociologist at the University of Chicago, he was a member of educated Black culture, like Anna Julia Cooper but in a different field of expertise. He became chair of the Department of Sociology at Fisk University in Nashville Tennessee, and from that position he launched a survey of college-educated Blacks in the U.S., collected results in the early 1930s, and from them developed a data-driven study in The Negro College Graduate, published in 1938.

      The occupational survey was surely intended to be progressive, led by a Black sociologist to better understand economic conditions and demographic trends among educated Blacks in the US. Yet clearly the survey questions sent to collect data for Johnson's occupational study sparked tension with Anna Julia Cooper. Frequently it seems she found there was not enough space to address some complicated matters, and occasionally she questions the questions themselves. Here is a portion of the survey that is full of critical backtalk:

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ethical-lens-1-669" />

      *Figure 3: *This slider compares the original version against the transcribed and encoded version, capturing Anna Julia Cooper's backtalk in very different ways.**\
      To question 36, "How well did you do in college?" Cooper snaps back, "Hardly a fair question for personal answer" and continues trailing upside down on the top page margin in a rather challenging passage for us! A little later (shown in the same image), question 38 asks, "What is your attitude toward educational methods of instruction in college? (Mention the strongest and weakest features?" Cooper retorts indignantly, "Too broad to be answered in 2 lines." And characteristically, she continues and finds space anywhere she can to write a full and serious response.

      The survey that Anna Julia Cooper filled out, to be clear, was just one of hundreds of data points, collected and aggregated as a whole. Yet as far as I and my students know, at least, Cooper's completed survey is the only one we have seen filled out by an individual by hand. It would be a fascinating illumination of early 20th-century Black history of education to find more such, and yet Cooper's is certainly a distinct voice worthy of excerpting from the quantitative demographic survey work of Johnson's book. While that book occasionally features quotes from individual surveys, it does not seem to have taken note of Cooper's response. Instead, her survey contributes to charts like this one from Johnson's book:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/fb66b2aa1827c41fc0d455fd5026f4bceca3dc0e-71096.png)\*Figure 4: Table of data on Black female college graduates from The Negro College Graduate, 156.\*The manuscript of Anna Julia Cooper's written responses shows a remarkable talking back, a debate, a voice at odds with the surveyors that has a lot more to say than they formally expected. At the time of this writing, we do not know how Cooper's rather vocal data point was processed by Charles Johnson or his colleagues at Fisk University. Johnson's sociological book tends to aggregate responses and speak to patterns over multiple years of survey collection, and when it speaks of remarkable individuals they tend to be male. Perhaps the curation of the survey as sent in 1930 can show us what was assumed by progressive data collectors in 1930 about educated Black Americans, what was assumed about their personal lives and history, their parentage, and to what heights they could aspire.

      The survey Cooper received in 1930 was six pages long, with the last page reserved for "special comment." Her writing, as we have mentioned, thoroughly fills those pages. Multiple responses overflow the printed lines for a response, and some responses, in particular to questions 46 and 67 reflect on views of race and of education and are continued on the open last page, numbered and marked to guide the reader. Cooper's passion for learning and teaching is profoundly expressed.When the survey asks, "As you regarded it then, what motives prompted you to go to college?", Cooper responds, "innate & indomitable 'wanting to know'". When the survey asks, "Are you at present employed upon the occupation of your choice?", Cooper answers, "Yes." The survey continues, "the vocation for which you were prepared?" and Cooper responds, "the Education of neglected people." When it asks if the respondent votes where they live, Cooper responds, "None do." Frequently Cooper's responses take issues with the language or presumptions in the survey questions, such as when the survey asks the respondent to identify racial factors that interfered with finding a chosen career: Cooper appears to take issue with the notion that her racial identity would have interfered with her goal to teach, but also comments on how her students were blocked access to scholarships they should have been able to apply for.

      *Figure 5: Click on the slider above to show the difference between the original form and the transcribed and enriched text*

      Patricia Collins in Black Feminist Thought highlights the importance of particular tensions and frictions in Black women's experience as reminders that interpersonal conflicts reflect "intersecting oppressions, for example, intersections of race and gender," and that a "matrix of domination" describes the organization of those intersecting oppressions (18). The complex position of Anna Julia Cooper being interviewed by Charles Johnson is full of intersectional sparks that perhaps illuminate a conflict over authority to define the condition of race and the significance of a college education sharply in the decades before the Civil Rights era in the U.S. Cooper's hand both replies and critiques, taking issue with the page in a way that absolutely calls for close reading and document analysis, where the survey form becomes a kind of dialogic groundwork inspiring Cooper's most memorable elucidations on race and education.

      ##### TEI for handwriting on a survey form

      To share the manuscript survey and try to make it readable and searchable online represented an exciting challenge for us. We set out to represent the document to share the interactions of Anna Julia Cooper's handwriting with the printed survey questions. We wanted our work to show a dynamic back-and-forth: how Cooper's responses rounded against the questions, how those responses push against the restraints of the expected answer, how they expose the survey authors' assumptions.

      We needed to figure out the best way to distinguish the handwritten responses from the printed survey. Should we code the survey questions in a separate document or separate portion of our file? We opted against this because the questions and answers seemed to represent a unit of thought: something like a call and response that needed to be stored together in context. There was no pattern for this that we could find in the TEI Guidelines or previous projects, and perhaps what we began here can be a starting point for future work on formal documents like surveys and others that combine print and handwriting in meaningful ways, documents in which the handwriting on its own is not complete without the print context it is addressing, and where the handwriting is an equal partner with the print, more than simply annotation or marginalia.

      <IframeElement w={640} h={360} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ep1Plm1Iy30?si=G2EYKYRJAmIhSYX2" title="YouTube video player" />

      TEI is a markup language with many possibilities for many different kinds of texts, from dictionaries to poems, from stage plays to scripture, and from descriptions of page surfaces and handwriting to printed documents. It's a good idea for TEI projects to deliberately make choices about encoding for consistency, and to limit all the possible tags we could use. My students and I spent about two weeks in October doing "exploratory markup," that is, finding ways to mark the document using the TEI Guidelines. My students' individual homework assignments involved taking a small section of the survey of their choice, and choosing how to encode it after reading chapters and examples from the TEI. Preparing for class in those weeks, I compiled the students' homework files and took the best developed versions and reworked them with my own code. We would discuss different approaches in class. While this case study cannot in itself constitute a thorough orientation to the TEI, our approach has always been "ad hoc," looking at examples and setting students to work exploring and combining and reviewing together with me as a guide. In the end we came up with a combination of markup forms using the TEI numbered div elements and the \<ab> element to hold questions, and setting the \<add> element inside them to hold Cooper's responses. You can see the document structure we created in the TEI file: [https://github.com/newtfire/Anna-Julia-Cooper\\\_Survey\\\_Edition/blob/main/Semester%20Project/AJCSurvey-TEI.xml](https://github.com/newtfire/Anna-Julia-Cooper\\_Survey\\_Edition/blob/main/Semester%20Project/AJCSurvey-TEI.xml)

      To make the text searchable for scholars of Cooper's world, I asked students to apply persName, placeName, and orgName markup from the TEI. Later my students would be able to extract this information into a navigational guide to the people, places, and organizations Cooper mentioned as important to her educational trajectory and life's work.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/45444fdbf6a8aeea9737747ce5553a566df6639e-71100.jpeg)*Figure 6: Our TEI encoding of question 22 with Cooper's response, showing encoding of an early important influence on her teaching career, Dr. J. Brinton Smith. You can also see that at the time we did not encode every proper name, leaving out book titles. This coding can always be added later! Given time constraints of a university semester, we prioritized capturing certain information about people and places and organizations in Cooper's life.*\
      One idea that I prepared in our plans, but that never caught on with the students was to store in attribute values two counts: a count\
      of lines provided in the survey document to answer a given question, and a count of lines actually written by Cooper. I envisioned a sort of measurable Metric of Resistance in noting a) how frequently and b) by how much Cooper's responses exceeded the lines printed for responses on the form. We could divide the number of lines Cooper used by the count of the lines provided for each question, and then calculate the averages as our Metric of Resistance. Though we never followed through on it in establishing the edition, perhaps we can go back and add this feature someday.

      ##### Student encoders and interface designers

      One of the delights of working with TEI is the number of different ways you can build with it. Because TEI systematically expresses document structures and ideas and information about the text (or metadata), we can write code that extracts many different kinds of information, use it for analysis as well as for displaying illuminated visualizations of the source text. In digital humanities work, this is an area that combines creativity, graphic design, and scholarly analysis of curated documents. One of the most important, vital creative portions of the Text Encoding class is when students learn to write XSLT to design their own HTML pages from the TEI they prepared.

      My student Alice Rong worked on the transformation of TEI with XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheets Transformation Language) to create an HTML file and prepare CSS (cascading Stylesheets). These forms of code are related and part of the topic of our class: to learn text encoding and what you can build and design with it for sharing on the web. The forms of code mention styling and were modeled on older pre-computer technologies used in print publishing. Blocking and layout follows a design concept that Alice developed. At first, like most of my students, Alice wanted to use a computer handwriting-style font to show Cooper's handwriting, but I cautioned:

      1. That this might not be easy for people to read, and
      2. The digital edition does not need to look like the original in order to be accurate and authentic to the source document.

      On reconsideration, Rong came up with a design that would mimic the way a PDF form looks to us when we fill it out. A distinct font and CSS styling would set off the writing of Cooper from the typeface of the survey. Other forms of styling would help to indicate passages we could not read, as well as signal when parts of the document would overflow to other pages. Finally, information could be "pulled" from the markup to help create a directory of proper names marked in the survey, designed to assist scholars in finding their way to interesting information.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7d9a69b1f728616271975afd332ad35c8155bfe2-71097.png)*Figure 7: Above is a screen capture of a portion of the reading view that Alice Rong prepared, using XSLT to transform TEI XML to HTML. You can see Cooper's responses, as well as some information supplied by us (some editorial "metadata") in red over grey background to describe when the writing is cut off or moves out of bounds supplied by the survey form.*\
      In the limited time of a university semester, we concentrated on the problem of representing this text, though in a real way the text itself was our guide to the vexations of Anna Julia's life as an accomplished, highly literate Black woman attempting to make a difference as an educator in the U.S. of 1930. Alice designed a preview screen for the digital edition to help people find their way to questions mentioning particular people, places, and organizations of interest. (As an XSLT challenge, this could be redone as an index, listing only the distinct people once, and providing a list of questions.)

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/64d2dd61d577515a8df0220885724df85ee235bb-71098.png)

      *Figure 8: Alice Rong's design of a table to preview the survey questions and link directly to those mentioning particular names of interest.*

      Though I wish that my students had time to investigate more of Cooper's context, they really dedicated themselves to the considerable challenge of representing the document and powerful voice they were encountering. And they thought carefully about how best to design an interface to represent the complexities they could model in code. Perhaps there is a limitation in a technologically-driven digital humanities class that prioritizes learning markup and code: there was so much to do here to plan the text encoding and to build and design the web interface that we had to choose how much we could accomplish within school time. Perhaps it is best to think of this as a project in building groundworks and establishing foundations for continued work, in which we find undergraduate students without a strong background in history able to study a manuscript and learn to trace its events on the page. Most of my students do not think of themselves as historical scholars, but they do think of themselves as graphic designers and web developers, and the act of curation gave them a new and worthy challenge.

      In the spirit of digital humanities projects, perhaps they are never really finished and we create them in stages in hopes that they continue some other way, some other time. This digital project is freely shared with a Creative Commons license requesting that if the work is re-used, its developers be properly cited, that the reuse not be for commercial profit, and that it be shared on the same terms with others. We hope this is a micro-edition worth exploring, forking, and building on by other students and scholars who find their way to Cooper perhaps as we did.

      ##### **Introduction**

      Researchers working in Digital Humanities are becoming increasingly aware of a panoply of ethical considerations involved in their research. These include issues relating to data privacy, cultural sensitivity, accessibility, transparency, and representation. These questions are in addition to more traditional ethical considerations within the humanities such as providing due consideration to previous scholarship. But as humanities researchers have moved from being consumers of scholarship as well as the infrastructures in which that scholarship exists (eg databases, metadata, knowledge systems) to developers of infrastructure, from remediation of the physical to the digital, the development and use of standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative, the creation of databases, and the expansion of existing metadata schema, new ethical, moral, and legal considerations emerge.

      Digital Humanists regularly navigate complex ethical considerations related to translation and representation, including issues of cultural sensitivity, accuracy, and the potential for misrepresentation. These issues are particularly important in the context of DH research, which often involves the use of digital tools and methods that may impact the representation of individuals and communities. Moreover, DH scholarship must be mindful of the intersection between ethics and the law, particularly with respect to issues such as data privacy, intellectual property, and informed consent. DH scholars must ensure that their research practices not only comply with local, national, or international law and regulation, but it is incumbent upon researchers to engage in critical reflection on the ethical implications of their work.

      Questions that guide such research might include how can we ethically collect and use data in our projects. What steps can be taken to ensure that our scholarship respects diverse cultures and perspectives? Additionally, it is important to consider the potential biases that can emerge in DH projects and how best to mitigate them. Researchers need to balance between the requirements of the open science movement and considerations for the privacy and cultural sensitivity of the data they work with (Lawson 2019). Moreover, adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) becomes paramount in ensuring that digital data and resources are not only open but also usable and sustainable in the long term. And lastly, one should be aware of the power dynamics involved in data collection, algorithmic decision-making, and digital representation. By recognizing these challenges, it is possible to create projects that are fair, inclusive, and respectful, as well as understand how ethical issues were dealt with when utilising the projects created by others.

      By adopting ethical principles in their research practice, digital humanists can contribute to a more ethical and just digital landscape. As the case studies in this section demonstrate, ethical considerations are not a set of rigid rules, nor a fixed set of methods, but rather an ongoing process of critical thinking and reflection guided by a commitment to integrity, social responsibility, and the well-being of all stakeholders involved. As such, ethical research revolves around three key concepts: ethics, morality, and legal frameworks.

      For many researchers, especially those who receive grant funding, it is increasingly necessary to apply for institutional ethics approval before beginning one’s research. Nicholas Proferes (2020) describes this adherence to ethical standards as compliance. Compliance within an ethical framework is about mitigating institutional risk and liability, particularly concerning human subjects, while complying with the legal framework(s) in the jurisdiction in which the research takes place. But as the case studies in this section demonstrate, ethical considerations in digital scholarship increasingly go beyond these institutional reviews. This is particularly true due to rapid changes in technology, as well as moral considerations that are in flux responding to changes in society, and within one’s research community.

      For example, in taking a compliance approach, researchers need to obtain informed consent from research participants, while ensuring that their research practices respect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals and communities. But Proferes also describes an alternative or additional approach -- that of ethics as contemplation:

      > Ethics, in one (ideal) sense, is about using our capacities for reason and judgment to achieve ‘the good life’ vis-à-vis moral action and/or personal character. . . . Ethics as contemplation suggests an ongoing practice of inward reflection about our own actions about what is right and just.

      Ethics as contemplation goes beyond institutional requirements to ‘the ideal we should continuously aspire towards’ (Proferes 2020).

      ##### **Ethical principles and values in Digital Humanities**

      Digital humanists find themselves in a unique position, at the intersection of their foundational scientific disciplines and the technological solutions offered to facilitate their research efforts or advance their studies. In this convergence of disciplines, a comprehensive understanding of ethical considerations is required that extend beyond traditional academic boundaries. During the implementation of digital humanities research projects, it is crucial to adhere to the fundamental ethical codes of the relevant fields and disciplines while simultaneously respecting ethical principles arising from the digital processing, storage, and utilisation of research results.

      On the one hand, respecting the rights of individuals and communities that are the subjects of research, as well as promoting responsible and ethical behaviour, has long been imperative in the humanities. Ethical research principles, encompassing respect for research participants, transparency in data collection and analysis, and ethical standards in interpreting results, are fundamental guidelines for any humanities project. They significantly influence the shaping of the entire research process. On the other hand, the development, implementation, and use of digital technologies have also long been recognized as involving different ethical issues. Bernd Carsten Stahl predicts that these ethical considerations will continue to evolve, fostering future discussions that go beyond current debates on computer ethics and artificial intelligence ethics, based on new technologies and their applications (Stahl, 2022: 65). The integration of advanced technologies into the research and advancement of humanities requires thoughtful exploration of potential biases embedded in algorithms, privacy concerns, and power dynamics that may arise, and digital humanists must be particularly cautious in this regard. They have the task not only of pushing the boundaries of knowledge but also pioneering ethically sound practices in the intricate intersection of technology and the humanities.

      Social justice and ethical considerations are crucial issues in the field of digital humanities. While, on the one hand, digital humanities projects can be powerful tools for social change, on the other hand, there is a risk of reinforcing existing power structures: algorithms and technologies are not neutral. Rather, they result from a design that incorporates human values and assumptions. If “our society exhibits biases or unethical behaviour, these biases will be reflected in the data that are collected and the choices self-learning algorithms make for us and for others” (Klockmann at al., 2022). Algorithms used in research, encompassing techniques such as the analysis of large datasets, classification, filtering, natural language processing (NLP), or data visualisation, enable digital humanists to expedite research processes and gain new insights into their respective fields. However, the fundamental assumption for their proper functioning lies in the quality of the available data. If the data is biassed or incomplete, the results of analyses or decisions made can reflect these biases (Leurs, K., & Shepherd, 2017) Since ‘algorithms do not have a conscience, personal preferences, or moral agency’ (Gilli et al., 2020), the responsibility lies on experts to be aware of inherent biases and actively work towards recognizing and rectifying them. Through systematic analysis and improvement of data quality, they can reduce the likelihood of reproducing biases in research outcomes or algorithm-based decisions. Such reflexivity and engagement in working with data can be pivotal in creating digital environments that foster objectivity and fairness (for more information on this topic, see the Data Feminism case study in this unit. Data Feminism, as part of the broader movement for social justice in digital humanities, recognizes that data and algorithms are not neutral).

      The development of digital initiatives conceals another situation that has the potential to deepen social injustice. Namely, numerous individuals and even groups worldwide lack access to the internet, placing them in a position of disadvantage. On one hand, their limited representation in existing digital sources and projects can be observed, as well as their inability to participate in innovations. In other words, the unjust distribution of access to technology can result in further marginalisation of certain groups in the digital environment.

      It is important to be aware of this power dynamic in digital initiatives and work towards ensuring accountability and transparency, constantly questioning and exploring ‘the dark side of DH (Smithies 2022). The Case Study Lights and Shadows: The PhilPeriodicals Collaboration Between the Philippines and Belgium in DH Digitization and Training provides an example of this.

      There is also the issue of privacy and data security collected within the scope of research. It is crucial to ensure that data is collected and stored in ways that respect individuals' privacy and that appropriate protective measures are in place to prevent data breaches. It is thus crucial to respect and adhere to legal frameworks as there are formal sanctions for their violation. Legal frameworks encompass laws, regulations, and policies that govern the use and management of data, privacy, and intellectual property. Navigating the legal and ethical issues involved in research and the publication of research results can be challenging for a researcher. Additionally, caution should be exercised when using copyrighted materials, seeking permission when necessary. For assistance in navigating these regulations, please refer to the Toolkit Section of this course.

      The digitization of cultural heritage objects raises important ethical questions about ownership, consent, and representation, and digital humanists, along with the archives and museums that house this heritage, must grapple with these challenges in their efforts to make their collections more accessible to researchers and the public. By working closely with communities and engaging in open and transparent dialogue, it is possible to take steps to address these ethical considerations and ensure that making these objects publicly available is done in an ethical and responsible manner.

      Additionally, our scholarship needs to be mindful of cultural diversity and sensitivity and of the audiences who may view and/or interact with our scholarship. This is an example of Proferes’ ‘contemplative ethics’ in which researchers need to continually engage in critical reflection on the assumptions and values that underpin their research practices and avoid perpetuating universalizing or homogenising narratives.

      While the field of digital humanities offers us remarkable opportunities for research and collaboration, an understanding of history, as well as contemporary life and cultural heritage, these opportunities come with responsibilities. As DH scholars and practitioners, we must navigate complex ethical landscapes to ensure that our work and our projects contribute positively to society and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and communities.

      A good place to start in working towards more ethical scholarship is through The Makkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. The centre provides a number of resources for researchers wishing to apply ethical practices to their research. These include a framework for ethical decision-making, including a short video and a poster that provides a summary of the framework.

      <IframeElement w={600} h={335} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRqOWScCjJM?si=HIJIy-R-SCX_uxqA" title="YouTube video player" />

      Other principles that can help govern the decision-making process when working with specific communities are The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. The foundation of The CARE Principles acknowledges that ‘the current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests (for more information on the FAIR principles, see the case study in this section). The Principles acknowledge that as researchers working with indigenous communities and/or their cultural patrimony, we are confronted with conflicting ethical and moral demands:

      Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous knowledge for collective benefit.

      For further information on The CARE Principles, see the Case Study in this unit. For an example of The CARE Principles in practice, see the Case Study Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the Researcher’s Responsibilities

      Balancing openness with considerations of power dynamics, historical contexts, and respect for human rights is integral to fostering a just and ethical landscape in digital humanities research.

      ##### **Conclusion**

      The Case Studies in this unit are divided into two parts. The first part consists of principles, frameworks, and concepts that guide ethical practices in digital scholarship. These include Data Feminism, The FAIR Principles, The CARE Principles, and A Framework for Ethical Decision Making. The rest of the Case Studies provide examples of digital scholarship that foreground ethical practices. This unit should also be read in conjunction with The Toolkit which provides many examples of tools, software, methods, and frameworks from which to conduct ethical scholarship.

      ###### This case study is written by Anna Villarica and is based on the book *Data Feminism* by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. The page is also designed by Anna Villarica.

      ##### What is data feminism?

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8fdb86ff5288b335ebde02bcb0a9d343e9e4a36e-71149.jpeg)Data feminism is the application of intersectional feminist approaches to data science. It is a framework developed by digital humanities scholars Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. In their book ‘Data Feminism’, they define it as ‘a way of thinking about data that is informed by direct experience, commitment to action, and intersectional feminist thought’ (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020, p. 8). Recognising the inequalities produced and reinforced in different stages of working with data, D’Ignazio and Klein argue for a more thoughtful and reflexive way of conducting data science work.

      To this end, they outline seven principles to operationalize feminism in the data sciences. These principles focus on transparency, accountability, and recognize not only the biases that feed into the data, but also the potential of using data science to challenge power. Data feminism is part of a larger push for social justice in the digital humanities. Digital humanities scholars have always worked at the intersection of the digital with humanist concerns. With emerging technologies, they are afforded new opportunities for conducting research, as well as new ways to use these tools to advance important causes.

      ##### Why data?

      Data has been called the new oil. Oil-related metaphors and vocabulary abound – data is a resource that can be ‘mined’, ‘processed’ and turned into profits. Powerful institutions that have the resources to harvest data can use it to their benefit. For instance, large companies like Google and Amazon are able to work with data to send targeted ads to their users. Government institutions are also able to collect and access data on citizens and base their decisions and expenditures on those. Those who hold the data wield power, similar to nations with vast amounts of oil resources at their disposal.

      Data is also like oil in that it can worsen inequalities. In some cases, the discovery of oil can lead to exploitation and worse conditions for the local populations while oil companies make money. Likewise, inequalities can also arise when data procedures are applied on certain people. When data is collected on vulnerable populations, for example, it can lead to categorization and further stigmatization of such groups, at the same time benefiting the people holding the data. Algorithms based on big data have been found to be biased towards people of a certain gender or race, for example (Noble 2018; O’Neil, 2017).

      <IframeElement w={640} h={170} alt="" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/4BZIwFlL0IZr6kH6VUVqqx?utm_source=generator" />

      *Data may be gold, but who is harmed? (Listen to the Data Fails Podcast on Spotify.)* *Ali Dunn and Jade Greer of the Data Feminism Network discuss how data has been used or misused. Applied to recruiting, the car industry, welfare and more, consequences range from hilarious to disastrous.*

      At the same time, people tend to see data as neutral, objective and fair as they are based on numbers. Data feminists note however that data are not as objective as they appear. For D’Ignazio and Klein, a data visualization is an example of a ‘rhetorical object’ which is ‘a communicating object that reflects choices about the selection and representation of reality’ (2020, p. 78). After all, data are produced through processes of collecting, selecting, processing, interpreting and visualizing phenomena. These social contexts that give rise to that data should not be neglected. Choices are made by humans throughout these steps, leading to datasets, algorithms and visualisations that may be based on numbers, but reflect the opinions, beliefs, and biases of those who interacted with data. Given that only 15% of people in data science and analytics are female and less than three percent are people of colour (Duranton et al., 2020), we should be concerned.

      ##### Why feminism?

      > *"I*ntersectional feminism, when applied to the unequal balance of power in data science, can help that power be challenged, can help it be rebalanced, and ultimately help it be changed’" -Lauren Klein\*\*\
      > Feminism is concerned with equal rights for all genders. Beyond being a gender-related issue, however, feminism is concerned with power imbalances and what structural forces have caused them over a long period of time. The goal of feminism is to understand and challenge these power systems to achieve equality. Data feminism borrows from intersectional feminism in particular. Intersectional feminism, borne out of Black feminism, believes that forces of power intersect with each other and the processes of discrimination that result are complex. Structural forces contribute to discrimination or privilege which we experience, based on various factors like gender, class, race, religion and so on. These result in interlocking systems of oppression that become difficult to separate and compound each others’ effects. Data science practices likewise result in issues of inequality, power and representation, so it makes sense to apply intersectional feminist theories to them. D’Ignazio and Klein build their data feminism framework around seven principles which serve as best practices to guide people working with data.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/slider-of-data-feminism-principles-661" />

      ##### Case #1 Missing data and counterdata

      ###### (Principles 1,2,5)

      Data feminist practice begins by examining power structures and how that is reflected in our data and data practices. For example, what types of data are collected or not, or which ones are made publicly available, could say a lot. In our data-saturated landscape, there are datasets that are conspicuously absent. Artist Mimi Onouha examines this in her installation: The Library of Missing Datasets. Onuoha’s exhibit is a physical drawer that contains the types of data that governments choose not to spend resources on, or choose to hide. As Onuoha notes, ‘Wherever large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live…That which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to...Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences’ (Onuoha, n.d.).

      Beyond examining power, research-activists are also actively using data to challenge or ‘counter’ this power. Such ‘counterdata’ practices could include compiling data sheets, publishing maps, digital storytelling and more. One concrete example is the feminicide map started by Maria Salguero in Mexico. Feminicide is the killing of women or girls due to their gender. In Mexico, an average of eight girls are killed each day. While the Mexican government has promised to clamp down on feminicide, it neglects to count and register such cases and their official feminicide data are not available in disaggregated form (D’Ignazio, 2022). Maria Salguero, a human rights activist and geophysical engineer from Mexico, decided to collect and map the data herself. She spends about three hours a day poring through sources, verifying and structuring the data in order to be able to plot them on the map. This grassroots project also involves the public (non-data experts) who can send information to Salguero. Her unofficial database is the largest publicly accessible dataset on feminicide in Mexico, helping families find missing women, supporting the work of journalists and nonprofits, and making the victims’ stories visible (D’Ignazio, 2022). Salguero’s work challenges power and contributes towards justice for the victims.

      ##### Case #2 Emotional and multi sensory data

      ###### (Principles 3,5)

      In data visualization, what is missing are ‘emotion and affect, embodiment and expression, embellishment and decoration’ as these experiences have been ascribed to women and thus not as valued in society (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). We have been trained to put reason on top of emotion, and as a result data visualizations often have clean layouts, 2D and minimalist designs. D’Ignazio and Klein ask: What happens when we allow emotions back in? They advocate for the ‘visceralisation’ of data – that is, to make data that we can respond to physically and emotionally.

      D’Ignazio and Klein use the example of US Gun Killings visualizations to illustrate the impact of emotional data. Rather than a static visualization, this uses arcs to represent someone’s life, starting with a bright orange line, growing and growing, until the point at which they are shot and killed, turning the line to grey. Each represents a life cut short due to gun violence, and a cumulative ‘Stolen Years’ dashboard counts (based on data about potential lifespans) how many years these people as a whole did not get to enjoy. Visualisations such as these stick with viewers, as they combine reason and emotion. However, they are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to their emotional appeal.\
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/76bc9c5d101a64112232f1ddb7cfcf6726643a7c-71151.gif)*Gif credit: Benjamin Wiederkehr, from data in [https://guns.periscopic.com/](https://guns.periscopic.com/)*

      Data is also often presented in textual 2D formats. What happens when data is turned into objects we can touch? Representing data in physical form is called data physicalization (Jansen et al., 2015). Being able to touch data also brings a different, more intimate experience of the object. Data physicalisation blurs the lines between creative, physical and conceptual exploration, ‘surfaces the labor involved with data production and representation’ (Koeser et al., 2020, p. 2), provides different perspectives and dimensions to the data, and allows the people interacting with it to be active participants (Koeser et al., 2020).

      This also allows more people into the realm of data science, which ties in with feminist principle five: Embracing pluralism. Through presenting data in multisensory formats, differently abled people could also participate in data science. Non-data experts such as artists and sculptors could also contribute to data science. With this, it is possible to expand our definition of data science, by bringing in the perspectives of individuals who may not be data practitioners per so, but who could contribute different ways of knowing and experiencing. Below are examples of physicalised data from the Gallery of Physical Visualizations maintained by Pierre Dragicevic and Yvonne Jansen.

      ###### **What is FAIR data and why does it matter?**

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/931c973059539c6eb5d9fb42a43cc36adebb2029-71156.png)The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship, published in 2016, provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets\[1]. They can serve to guide data producers and publishers helping to maximize the added value gained by scholarly digital publishing.\[2]

      Although originally developed in the life sciences, the FAIR principles are applicable to all research disciplines that deal with data, as they emphasise the importance of computational systems being able to find, access, interoperate and reuse data with minimal human intervention. Since their publication, the FAIR principles have been endorsed by the European Union, national funders and universities, leading to the development of data management policies, tools and infrastructures. Some projects adhere closely to the original FAIR definitions, while others are inspired by the spirit of the principles. Ensuring that data is FAIR is critical in the digital transformation space. FAIR data access is essential to enable researchers to find and access relevant data, leading to new insights and discoveries that would otherwise remain out of reach. Each letter of FAIR stands for one of the four basic principles

      * **F** - **F**indable
      * **A** - **A**ccessible
      * **I** - **I**nteroperable
      * **R** - **R**eusable

      the principles can be summed up in four points:

      **Both humans and machines are intended as digesters of data.**

      This will lead to the creation of an ecosystem that is fast to respond to change and automatically adapts to new findings or changes: the Internet of FAIR Data and Services. This is the reason for focusing on standards for data, identification mechanisms, data availability, etc.

      **The FAIR principles apply to both *data* and *metadata.***

      **The principles are not necessarily about open data.**

      You can and should work in a FAIR manner also with data that is not intended for public availability.

      **The FAIR principles are not rules or standards.**

      The FAIR principles must not be mistaken for rules or standards that you can use to evaluate tools, data, policies, etc. This would soon make the principles out-of-date and inapplicable across research disciplines. Adopting the FAIR principles will often be a gradual adaptation of work routines – but it could also be a huge leap, where you replace one type of infrastructure with another. It will be up to the different research areas and research communities to make the FAIR principles work in their respective contexts.

      ###### **FAIR data principles and how you can integrate them into your research**

      ***F - Make your data Findable***

      **Findable**\[1]\[3] means that data can be easily discovered by both humans and machines. This is achieved through the use of machine-actionable metadata and keywords that can be indexed by search engines and research data catalogs. Additionally, unique and persistent identifiers, such as DOIs or Handles, are used to reference the data, and the metadata includes the identifier of the data it describes. Easy discoverability of metadata and data is crucial for enabling their (re)use, and machine-readable metadata plays a vital role in automating the process of discovering datasets and services. The Findable principle is divided into 4 'sub-principles" \[1]

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/c56b4f784e085392da020f4462123196b24c1cf4-71157.jpg)

      As you can see, the quintessence of this principle is to make data discoverable for everyone through persistent identifiers and metadata. You can do so by \[3]

      * publishing your data in searchable repositories, e.g. Zenodo, as they assign persistent identifiers to resources, and by
      * adding machine-readable metadata (e.g. Dublin Core).

      ***A - Make your data Accessible***

      **Accessibility**\[1]\[3], as part of the FAIR principles, ensures that users are given guidance on how to access the desired data, which may involve authentication and authorization. It means that the data is stored and can be accessed using standard procedures. While it doesn't require open availability, information on data retrieval should be provided, such as labeling data as "Access only with explicit permission" and including contact details. Ideally, this accessibility information should be machine-readable.

      Similar to the Findable principle, the Accessible principle is also subdivided further \[1]:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/4c0c4afce474fc1db53bc6f68458ea1315af3176-71158.jpg)

      To make your data accessible, you simple have to do the following\[3]:

      * have openly available administrative metadata and attach a data licence or statement to it, which informs users how they can access the data

      * use a long-term storage solution for archiving, which ensures the data is retrievable by their persistant identifier using a standard protocol

      * give access to metadata (always)

      ***I - Make your data Interoperable***

      **Interoperability**\[1]\[3] guarantees the ability to exchange and utilize data across different applications and systems, even in the long term, by employing open file formats. It also entails the integration of data from various research fields, accomplished through the implementation of metadata standards, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and purposeful connections between data and associated digital research objects. Interoperability further necessitates the smooth interaction of data with analysis, storage, and processing applications or workflows.

      The Interoperability principle is divided in 3 sub-principles \[1]:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/d939aad118f077836845b3fc0f7d36b6cdb023b5-71159.jpg)

      To make your data interoperable, you should \[3]

      * use standardised structural metadata in an sufficient amount

      * use common standards, ontologies, terminologies, etc.

      * use open, and long-term viable file formats.

      ***R - Make your data Reusable***

      **Reusable**\[1]\[3] data in context of the FAIR principle is data, that are well-documented, curated, and provide contextual information. They adhere to community standards and have clear terms for access and reuse, ideally through machine-readable licenses. This promotes reproducibility and enables the design of new projects based on the original results. The FAIR principle aims to maximize data reuse by ensuring comprehensive descriptions of metadata and data.

      The Reusability principle is divided into 4 sub-principles \[1]:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/70d57afe67c933a4f34e250461c2a6d567c092b1-71160.jpg)

      In order to make your data reusable for others, you have to\[3]

      * add the relevant contextual information
      * use standardized structural metadata (incl. controlled vocabularies and ontologies used in your resp. research field)
      * use open, long-term viable file formats, and
      * add a machine-readable date license.

      Of course, it is not always possible to comply with all the principles - also because other laws often do not always allow the principles to be applied in their entirety - but you should try to be as FAIR as possible with your data. If you want to learn more about research data management, here is a eLearning Course, which might be interesting for you.

      Furthermore, in the "Tools and Tutorials" section of the Toolkit, you can find the "FAIR Data Maturity Model" - an interactive tool that helps you assess your data's FAIRness level.

      ###### **What does CARE mean and why does it matter?**

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b4271ac5b538bbd45fb4ef5ab90459e9e83bf3dc-71168.jpg)Data has become a valuable global resource today, influencing power dynamics, decision-making, innovation, and commercialization. This is further magnified by the rise of artificial intelligence and the merging of biological and digital realms through data-sharing platforms. However, Indigenous Peoples have historically faced data inequities and exploitation, leading to concerns about integrating Indigenous knowledge and approaches into data practices and policies. The recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in data is part of reclaiming control over data ecosystems and narratives in an era of open data and open science. By focusing on collective benefit and equity, Indigenous Peoples can shift from being passive data subjects to active data users for development and well-being. This transformative approach empowers Indigenous Peoples to govern and shape data policies, practices, ethics, and innovation.

      In general, indigenous presence is widespread across over 90 countries, encompassing over 370 million individuals with diverse cultures. They strive to preserve, develop, and transmit their cultures, knowledge, and relationships with their territories and resources. However, ongoing colonization processes and the globalization of Western ideas have led to the suppression and co-optation of Indigenous knowledge systems and data. This has limited their ability to recover, develop, and sustain their knowledge, hindering their realization of human rights and responsibilities.

      The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance address those issues. They are a set of guidelines developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) to promote ethical and respectful management of Indigenous data. The principles emphasize the importance of respecting the cultural values, rights, and interests of Indigenous peoples in the collection, management, and use of data that pertains to them. By focusing on people and purpose, they complement other open data principles, e.g. the FAIR principles, which primarily focus on the data itself. CARE recognizes the importance of Indigenous rights and interests in data and aims to promote Indigenous innovation and self-determination. By considering both people and purpose, the CARE Principles aim to empower Indigenous Peoples and ensure their knowledge and data are valued and utilized in a way that aligns with their worldviews and benefits their communities.

      CARE is also an acronym and stands for:

      * **C** - **C**ollective Benefit
      * **A** - **A**uthority to Control
      * **R** - **R**esponsibility
      * **E** - **E**thics

      The implementation of the CARE Principles alongside the FAIR Principles ensures that data reflect the realities of Indigenous Peoples, remain under Indigenous control, and promote knowledge discovery and innovation. These principles guide data producers, stewards, and publishers in affirming Indigenous rights to self-determination and addressing issues such as privacy and future use. Just as the FAIR Principles promote good data management practices, the CARE Principles encourage data users to be both FAIR and CARE in their approach.\[1]\[2]

      Like the FAIR principles, the CARE principles are subdivided further than the acronym suggests. The CARE principles consist of a total of 12 principles, which we will look at in more detail in the following section.

      ###### **How to implement the CARE principles**

      ***C - Collective Benefit***

      **Collective benefit**\[3]means that

      > Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.\[3]

      The first principle emphasizes the need to prioritize the collective benefit of Indigenous communities, rather than individual interests, in the collection and use of data. This includes respecting the diversity of Indigenous communities and recognizing that their data needs and priorities may differ from those of non-Indigenous communities.\
      Collective Benefit is further divided into three sub-principles, which state that the collective benefit should be:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0a80fd6a0abbb87214107d21300d9743e4586bc4-71169.jpg)

      To ensure that there is a collective benefit in light of the CARE principles:

      * the use and reuse of data by Indigenous people should be actively supported and promoted by governments and institutions

      * the Indigenous community should benefit from the data (e.g. enhancement of engagement, support regarding service and policy needs, transparency, and better decision-making)

      * the data is grounded in the community.

      ***A - Authority to Control***

      **Authority to Control**\[3] means, that

      > Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.

      The second principle emphasizes the need for Indigenous peoples to have control over their data, including the right to determine who can access their data and for what purposes. This principle also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting Indigenous data sovereignty, or the right of Indigenous peoples to govern their data according to their cultural values and norms.

      Authority to Control is also divided into 3 sub-principles:

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0793de478e46f8dc9cf10456caba2472b197f9f8-71170.jpg)

      For the data to fulfill this principle,

      * indigenous rights and interest in the indigenous data and knowledge must be recognized and implemented in policies

      * indigenous data must be available and accessible for indigenous people

      * indigenous people should be active leaders in the stewardship of the data

      ***R - Responsibility***

      **Responsibility**\[3] means, that

      > Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self determination and collective benefit.\[3]

      The third principle emphasizes the need for all parties involved in the collection, management, and use of Indigenous data to act responsibly and with care. This includes promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance, and ensuring that data is used in ways that respect the cultural values and rights of Indigenous peoples.

      The Responsibility principle is divided into three sub-principles, which say that you should be responsible

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/c1ff3d4fd6342fa097259f3ca77f63bf3ff9031d-71171.jpg)

      To act responsibly with indigenous data:

      * relationships and the data creation should be built on trust, respect, reciprocity, and a mutual understanding

      * the usage of the data should foster the data literacy in the community

      * resources must be designed to generate data based on the worldviews and languages of indigenous people

      ***E - Ethics***

      **Ethics**\[3] in light of the CARE principles means, that

      > Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.\[3]

      The fourth principle emphasizes the need for ethical considerations to guide the collection, management, and use of Indigenous data. This includes respecting the privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy of Indigenous individuals and communities, as well as the need to avoid using data in ways that may cause harm or perpetuate discrimination or bias.

      Like its predecessors, the Ethics Principle is divided into 3 sub-principles, which state that ethical considerations should be

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/a54ab21aa28d03eaa2188d8355860f5ef5db1332-71172.jpg)

      To work ethically with indigenous data, you have to ensure, that

      * the data does not stigmatize the communities, cultures and their knowledge

      * ethical risk assessments should be done beforehand and from the perspective of the resp. community

      * imbalances in power and resources are addressed in the ethical processes

      * ethical processes include representatives of the resp. communities

      * metadata should state and acknowledge the provenance and purpose of the data as well as limitations and obligations of use

      The CARE Principles are crucial in rectifying historical injustices around Indigenous data. By respecting Indigenous rights, values, and interests, these principles not only guide data handling but also serve as a beacon for ethical and respectful engagement, ensuring that data practices reflect the diverse realities of Indigenous cultures and contribute positively to their communities.

      ##### **Introduction**

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/84abdf427a04ce0c776576a5971b9cb1596b019d-71185.png)Digitization has facilitated access to the historic record in unprecedented ways. Yet many records, even in their digital form, remain difficult to use. What if users had access not only to the image but also to the text within the image? It was with this in mind that the Center for Digital Scholarship at the American Philosophical Society launched its Open Data Initiative (ODI). Under this initiative, CDS staff create datasets from APS collections focusing primarily on historic documents that are rendered more useful when computer readable. Opening up these documents to computational analysis permits unprecedented access and can help us gain a better understanding of the past. However, some datasets present complex challenges that practitioners of open data must consider before releasing data to the world.

      Take for example the Record of Indenture–an amazing resource of over 5,000 indenture records. Each record consists of a name, country of origin, length of contract, debt owed, and details on the terms of the indenture. This is extremely rich and valuable data. But users should be aware that each data point actually represents real human beings, who lived real lives, often under great duress. In most cases, the only information we have about them was captured, without consent, by someone who held a significant amount of power over them.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/is-indentures-650" />

      *Click on the hotspots to explore these indentures from the “Record of indentures of individuals bound out as apprentices, servants, etc., and of German and other redemptioners”. (Source: The digital collection Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America)*\
      Data is great for producing new scholarship and facilitating conversation. It can also reinforce structural harms, biases, and inequalities. Approaching data with empathy has become the guiding principle of the ODI. This case study highlights Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America, a digital project that takes a humanistic approach to open data and explores what it means to represent the human experience quantitatively.

      ##### **Legacy Data and Data Legacies**

      CDS had previously produced structured data versions of historical documents to increase their accessibility, including records from Eastern State Penitentiary and the postal records of Benjamin Franklin during his tenure as Postmaster of Philadelphia. These data projects had complexities, but the data behind the ODI project that became Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America was much more challenging and required more nuance in approach. Sourced from a historical document entitled “Record of indentures of individuals bound out as apprentices, servants, etc., and of German and other redemptioners, 1771 October 3 - 1773 October 5,” some of the hurdles we faced turning this document into structured data involved missing, incomplete, and/or inaccurate entries as well as contemporary power differentials which influenced the data’s original collection. Therefore, a careful approach was necessary not only to ensure the integrity of the data produced and the knowledge derived from it but also to facilitate a humanistic process that we hoped would minimize any perpetuation of harm embedded in the original records.

      We had to confront these hurdles early on. The transcription process of the Record of Indentures ledger revealed something that often doesn’t become visible until the analysis/knowledge production stage of dealing with data: the subjectivity of the information at hand. Firstly, a number of pages missing from the ledger as well as some hard-to-decipher handwriting necessitated the supplemental use of a previously published version of the ledger, put out by the German Society of Pennsylvania (GSP) in 1907. Created primarily for use by genealogists, this volume was differently structured and did not include all information fields present in the original ledger. A close comparison also revealed alteration of the ledger’s contents in the GSP volume - one example being the omission of the names of women, sometimes recorded simply as “wife.” The context of the GSP rendering of the ledger’s data is now apparent, it was easier to see the biases, limitations, and embedded power relationships therein.![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8ed9a2aa380303d7553bd92a162b678d01061a4c-71186.jpg) *The women’s names in the ledger were often neglected and recorded simply as “wife”.

      \*Listen to Dr. Loukissas talk about the difference between data sets and data settings, and why it matters.\*This was a stark reminder of the power relations that are always at play in the creation of any dataset and the human stories that can be lost to time as a result. One of our aims was to consider the ledger’s data critically and with care, which Yanni Loukissas notes “is critical in that it calls attention to neglected things” (Loukissas, 2019). To do that, we looked at what Loukissas (2019) calls a “data setting”, examining the context of the original ledger by asking who created the ledger’s entries to begin with, and why. The ledger’s data setting - a document created by government employees as a legal record to enforce business contracts and property claims - made evident the numerous biases present in this information and the absence of equitable representation of those human beings about whom the data was recorded. This data was “made of bodies,” in the words of D’Ignazio and Klein (2020). We are humanists, and we recognize that data, especially when decontextualized, can cause direct or indirect harm to the privacy, safety, or well-being of source individuals, communities, traditions, and cultures, especially those which have been or are subjected to marginalization. And our role as stewards means that, in addition to “protecting” the data at hand from losing its integrity and value, we also have the responsibility of anticipating the damage that the \*data\* could do from beyond the grave.

      ##### **Humanistic Approaches to Data**

      Once processed, the data from the Record of Indentures was used to produce visualizations that form the foundation of our online exhibition. Early in the process, we decided to present the macro-level view of the data set through visualizations which allowed us to understand a typical contract, and thus also to isolate any outliers or unusual practices, along with the micro-level, which we took to be single data points which are, in other words, the individual stories that together comprise the Records.

      Each visualization thus acts as a window into the dataset, serving as a source of historical context, and each personal story serves as a mechanism to counteract a perceived absence of emotion that visualizations can facilitate. The Record Book of Indentures is filled with feeling; the pages capture the experience of five thousand individuals during a time in their life that would likely have involved a complex mix of emotions; hope, anxiety, sorrow, adventure, and hardship; their journey being far more than a line or dot in a visualization. To elide this fact would be to present only partial truth.

      ![Length of Indenture ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5a901274618662873e91d3bd06bbda647a8f1d51.png)

      *These charts demonstrate the number of years each person had to serve under the contract of indenture. (Source: The digital collection Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America)*\
      To best illustrate our approach to humanizing this dataset, we can turn to the case of Catherine Biesman whose contract of indenture was unusually long at 26 years, a fact that became clear in the production of the visualization above. Catherine’s record below shows that on August 1, 1772, she was indentured as a servant to James Smith, a contract that turned out to be a continuation of an initial agreement signed on September 17, 1771, with George Michael Kraft.

      *Click on the hotspots to learn about the case of Catherine Biesman whose contract of indenture was unusually long at 26 years. (Source: The digital collection* *Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America*\*)\*Our analysis of the dataset shows the average length of indenture to be four years. The length of Catherine's contract was 26 years - an unusually long period of time. Further investigation uncovered mention of Catherine in another dataset where we learn that she had previously resided in the Philadelphia Alms House. The record described Catherine as “mulatto”, a term used in the 18th Century for a person of mixed race and one that illuminates the inherently racialised structure of society at that time. Catherine’s contract was later transferred back to Kraft and she moved to the Northern Liberties area of Philadelphia to learn "Housewifery, to read in the bible, to write a legible hand, to sew plain work". Unfortunately, we can find no further information about Catherine. But, reading about this small part of her life personalises the dataset and allows us to appreciate a fraction of the emotion contained in its pages. We can understand that the visualizations remove us from the reality of the lived experience of the individuals they represent. In the exhibition currently, we have pieced together, from various sources, snapshots of the lives of three people within the Indenture Records. There remain over five thousand further records to explore.

      ##### **Conclusion**

      This case study has shown just one approach to open data. We were, and remain, excited about the potential uses of this data as it has the potential to tell thousands of stories and reveal new knowledge about migration, labor, and exploitation. However, the data can be extremely sensitive and we are both aware and concerned about the risks of excavating it from historic documents. While we offer a humanistic and empathetic approach to this data, on the other hand, it has the potential to be used for the wrong reasons. Such is the nature of data and of archives.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ef3e4d60f2106af8912879678453b29f42059b72-71205.jpeg)In Canada, we are working to address the history and ongoing contemporary impacts of the colonisation of Indigenous peoples and nations. Addressing these impacts and moving towards decolonisation takes many forms. Access to and control of all research data is one of many acts of decolonisation. Far more than a matter of asserting rights of ownership over cultural materials or ideas, data ownership represents a strong and dynamic connection between empowerment, cultural continuity, social cohesion, and resilience. A historically exploitative and “extractive” industry (Kovach 2005, 2010), research practices have a far too long history of inequity characterising Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations.

      The management of research data is a particularly pressing issue for Indigenous leaders, scholars, and communities\[1], given the vital connection between data and self-governance. The control of research materials is a foundational assertion of Indigenous nations’ and communities’ rights, including rights of ownership (FNIGC 2007). The misappropriation of cultural knowledge and problematic usage of Indigenous research data has further spurred Indigenous peoples, communities, and their allies to advocate for and advance the development, application, and implementation of research principles, protocols, and best practices as a means of establishing and rigorously reinforcing transparent and ethical standards in Indigenous research data management. And, as open access and research data management are becoming necessary components of research activity (see for example, Canada’s Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy), there is the concomitant need to ensure that historical inequities do not similarly emerge in contemporary data management practices.

      This case study offers an entry point to explore what Indigenous data sovereignty means in relation to research and creative practices. In exploring these issues, I hope that it helps you further understand our collective responsibility as researchers and scholars to the communities and individuals with whom we work.

      The case study is based on my own research and my navigation of the scope of considerations in Indigenous data management and sovereignty. I invite you to examine the possibilities, as well as the challenges, in establishing and following the highest standards of ethical, transparent, and sustainable principles and practices of data management toward ensuring Indigenous data sovereignty.

      ##### **What is Data Sovereignty?**

      Indigenous data sovereignty (IDSOV) is an assertion of Indigenous jurisdiction over all data about First Peoples, including information held by non-Indigenous governments and institutions. The global movement for Indigenous data sovereignty affirms the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to control how information about them is managed, accessed, and preserved (Carroll et al., 2020; FNIGC, 2014).

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/56d3bd0512704120cf79c49e879bc4482f78e0d0-71204.jpg)\
      The international Indigenous data sovereignty movement, which includes networks such as the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) and intellectual property initiatives such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) labels, offers comprehensive guidelines to assist in the implementation of Indigenous data sovereignty. In Canada, the OCAP® principles, outlined below, are the best known and while these principles generally apply as well to the Inuit and Métis Nations, these nations have developed their own research data management protocols (See for example, the National Inuit Strategy on Research).

      ##### **Why is Indigenous Data Sovereignty Important?**

      1. ###### **Indigenous Nations and Communities**

      “The term sovereignty refers to the fact that Indigenous Nations are sovereign in their governance and that extends to their data and knowledges as well. It recognizes that Indigenous people are the ultimate authority in their data and Knowledges and aims to redefine Indigenous peoples' relationship to research from being participants or subjects to being meaningful partners and co-researchers.” (University of Toronto Libraries - Indigenous Studies Research Guide, 2023)

      Indigenous peoples are the ultimate authority of their own data and possess the inherent right to control information about themselves. Whereas research practices have, in the past, varied from ethically sound to unmitigatedly exploitative, few considered matters of ownership and access in research agreements. Communities are now spelling out the terms of research engagement, including data ownership, usage, storage, and access as an inherent part of any research project. See for example: Indigenous Knowledges & Data Governance Protocol.\
      2\. ##### **Researcher**

      Indigenous research data sovereignty is a first principle of research engagement and foundational to research for and with Indigenous peoples and communities. Indigenous data sovereignty neither begins nor ends with the research itself. At the most basic level, researchers, when working with human participants, must follow research ethics protocols. In addition to these protocols and whether working with human participants or not, researchers must ensure that their work meets or exceeds the highest standard of research integrity. This process begins well in advance of the research phase and may involve a research ethics board of the researcher’s home institution and of the Indigenous nation with whom they will be working. Whether working with an Indigenous nation, community, group, or organisation, this includes following all of the requisite research protocols prior to engaging in any research activity, including an appropriate and agreed upon research data management plan. This may include any necessary memorandum of agreement, contracts, management of intellectual property rights, and/or the clarifying the parameters for the use of data. Researchers must ensure that the protocols are being followed for as long as is required. In that process, researchers must make every effort to ensure that the data or stories being shared, artefacts used, or lands explored have a clear set of practices regarding ownership of the data, its current use and future access, including publication rights and storage management and costs. Researchers must, in other words, collaboratively plan for as many contingencies as possible before, during and after any research is conducted and with a clear research data management plan in place.

      ##### \*\*Basic Principles

      OCAP® and CARE principles and values are the de facto current standards of research engagement, and are shaping, refining, and re-defining ethically sound research with Indigenous populations in Canada. The principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession/Stewardship, in particular, affirm First Nations’ control of data collection processes and that they own and control how this information can be accessed, used and stored (FNIGC 2019; First Nations Centre 2007).

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-ocap2-614" />

      In Canada there are a range of data sovereignty initiatives being undertaken by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit researchers, research organisations, and governments. As noted above, best known is OCAP® which was created in 1995 as a set of foundational principles to guide the standardisation of the processes for First Nations’ ownership and control over data, including its collection, access, use and storage. As a political and practical response to the use of data in reproducing colonial relations, the OCAP® principles assert Indigenous sovereign research data governance (Schnarch 2004; FNIGC 2014a, b; Espey 2002; First Nations Indigenous Governance Centre 2007).

      “The First Nations principles of OCAP® establish how First Nations’ data and information will be collected, protected, used, or shared. Standing for ownership, control, access and possession, OCAP® is a tool to support strong information governance on the path to First Nations data sovereignty. Given the diversity within and across Nations, the principles will be expressed and asserted in line with a Nation’s respective world view, traditional knowledge, and protocols.” [https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/)

      The CARE principles of Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics were developed by the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group. Working “in consultation with \[international groups of] Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organisations, and governments, the CARE principles were developed to be people- and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)” (Carroll et al 2020; see also Kukutai & Taylor 2016)\[2].

      ##### \*\*From Principles to Practice

      OCAP® was developed as “principles in evolution” rather than a “set of rules” or practices and with the understanding that there may be ambiguities or limitations in its application (FNIGC 2007). The overarching goal of OCAP®is to be as straightforward and transparent as possible, working towards a collaborative framework that adheres to “a Nation’s respective world view, traditional knowledge, and protocols” (FNIGC 2014). Moving from principles to practice is critical, however, and requires considerable attention to the specific details of a given research project.

      Moving from principles to practice offers researchers an opportunity to collaboratively develop an appropriate data management framework. The framework may be very straightforward, involve few consultations, and provide a clear path to ensuring a community’s priorities and protocols have been met. Researchers must nonetheless be aware of potential challenges or mitigating factors that will emerge in the process of moving from principles to practice.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-principles-to-practice-613" />

      In moving from principles to practice, in other words, are we actively rethinking the standards of research engagement with our collaborators and research partners. When initiating a project, the researcher must collaboratively and transparently ensure the implementation of best practices in the management of research materials. And, when research was completed long before Indigenous data sovereignty principles and guidelines were established, researchers should consider how to update their research agreements in order to implement data sovereignty best practices.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7c94a61c5441fbbeb259cd544bf17afb61bece16-71203.png)I began working with the Whapmagoostui First Nation (WFN) in the late 1980s. The WFN are Iiyiyu, or Cree, of Iiyiuyu Istchee - the peoples’ land - whose community is located on the Hudson Bay coast just north of the 55th parallel in Nunavik (northern Québec), Canada. After receiving permission to conduct a research project on the concept of health from an Iiyiyu perspective (see Adelson 2000 and Adelson, Mickelson, Kawapit 2021), I spent 18 months living in the Whapmagoostui community and, with the help of two translators, interviewing unilingual Cree-speaking elders. This research resulted in the publication of *Being Alive Well: Health and the Politics of Cree Well-Being* (U Toronto Press 2000) and its impact was realised, in particular, in the transformation of the language and practices of health care communication at the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (see Shrivastava et al 2020 and Miyupimaatisiiun Department).

      Decades later, on reviewing the richness of the detail in the narratives recorded and their transcriptions and in light of my commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty, I could neither destroy nor leave the research records unattended in a filing cabinet drawer. Bringing this issue to the attention of the then-Chief of the WFN, we began to develop a plan for digitising, transferring ownership, and archiving those records.

      Before any of the material could be transferred to the community, it had to be available in an accessible format. I had tape recordings, printed transcripts, and photographic slides. The paper records would not survive into the future and, in storage, were not organised in a coordinated fashion with the corresponding recordings. As well, the various tape recording devices I had used at the time - and the disks on which the transcripts were stored - were now obsolete. The organisation of the materials, digitisation, and creation of a systematic overarching organisation structure required the skills of a digital archivist (see Adelson, Mickelson, Kawapit 2021 for a summary of the process). Samuel Mickelson, the digital archivist who was brought on to the project, ensured that we created a clear, accessible, and catalogued data set, with the requisite preservation master, accessible files and clear metadata.

      With digitisation completed, the next step was to begin the process of facilitating access to - and local preservation of - the now accessible materials. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic, and the travel-limiting protocols which necessarily ensued, slowed this progress. We have begun to get back on track - recognising that any number of contingencies must be included in research - and research management - planning.\
      In future meetings with community representatives, we will discuss the development of a data transfer protocol and access plan. The discussion of access will begin with a review of the original consent form details, including how the interviews were originally meant to be used. As general access to the interviews was not consented to in those original forms, the community will determine whether I will need to contact family members of the original participants or if the WFN has the authority to make the decision regarding opening access beyond the requirements of the original project. Once that issue is resolved, we will then be able to discuss community and research access protocols, including whether all materials will be available to all members of the community or if any limitations will be set. This will also necessarily entail a discussion of whether there is a need for a content management system (CMS) to facilitate modifiable access. Finally, we will take into consideration the infrastructure needs, including how and where to house the data, who will manage the access, and if there are any long-term concerns regarding updates and future technologies.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f0b89500106d17d362455e8a345a6374eb271e38-71202.jpg)*The Passamaquoddy Mukurtu site. Image retrieved from [https://passamaquoddypeople.com](https://passamaquoddypeople.com).*

      One very interesting example of a content management system (CMS) that has been designed specifically for Indigenous communities is Mukurtu. Mukurtu, developed by the Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation (Washington State U) is a free, open-source platform created specifically for the needs of Indigenous communities. What is particularly interesting about Mukurtu is that is it built to “provide differential access to community members and the general public and to create space for traditional narratives and knowledge labels that foreground Indigenous knowledge in the metadata of digitised cultural heritage materials” ([https://humanitiesforall.org/projects/mukurtu-an-indigenous-archive-and-publishing-tool](https://humanitiesforall.org/projects/mukurtu-an-indigenous-archive-and-publishing-tool)). The Mukurtu CMS ensures that Indigenous communities decide the level and type of access based on their unique requirement and knowledge organisation categories.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-principles-to-practice-610" />

      I would like to note that with regard to the last point above, intellectual property (IP) rights originally ensured that I am the owner of my own research. In other words, IP rights privilege individual ownership and tangible heritage: I own what I write (until such time that my ownership shifts to public domain access). In practice, however - and in particular in the context of working with an Indigenous nation and community - these IP rights effectively complicate my ability to transfer that ownership to the WFN community. In order to ensure their ownership of what is currently “my” research (but, in truth, the community members’ own narratives), I will work with the WFN to draw up a memorandum of understanding which will outline the community’s rights to that intellectual property.

      Memoranda of Understanding are becoming more common as Indigenous communities and researchers work to address the limitations of intellectual property rights and establish more suitable terms of ownership and access.

      I will continue to work with the WFN to develop a memorandum of understanding and to collaboratively implement it towards a transfer of ownership as well as the transfer of all of the digitised data and their use, control and storage as they see fit.

      1. What is Indigenous data sovereignty and why is it historically important?
      2. What are the core principles of Indigenous data sovereignty?
      3. What can researchers do to ensure the application and implementation of principles, protocols, and best practices in the management of research materials when working for and with Indigenous communities? How do you think this changes research planning processes?
      4. What is an example of a best practice in conducting research with Indigenous peoples?
      5. What is an obstacle that a researcher might encounter in ensuring appropriate data management? How would you resolve that obstacle?
      6. Are you willing to transfer or share ownership of your research materials with a community or organisation? What would this look like?

      2.7 Safe Havens for Archives at Risk
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ###### This case study is written and designed by Anna Villarica. It is adapted from Professor David Sutton's article *Safe havens for archives at risk: a new international initiative.*

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/af7b9dd9ef9e74c5c061ce9d0da17888e1468b90-71229.png)

      ##### Archives at risk

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/putin-039-s-war-on-ukraine-039-s-archives-608" />

      An archive is an institution that collects, preserves, researches and enables use of records/documents and other material of lasting value generated by the activities of state bodies and institutions, organizations, individuals and families who have had a prominent role in history, communities, and media. Records can take many forms such as reports, registers, letters, photographs, films, maps, digital files and other primary sources (National Archives, 2016).

      As witnesses to the past, these provide ‘evidence, explanation and justification both for past actions and current decisions’. (ICA, 2016, para. 1). These documents facilitate education, research and good governance. Archives also help us understand our cultures and build our sense of identity (Cambridge, n.d.).

      Sometimes, archives are threatened in their country of origin, as can be seen in recent headlines from war zones in Sudan and Ukraine. In such cases, archives and other centres of knowledge become strategic targets. Read the flipcard on the right to find out more about these archives at risk in 2023.

      Archives may also be at risk due to natural disasters, climate change, or their presence in areas of unstable governance. Archival records in the Marshall Islands, for example, are under threat from sea level rise and extreme weather events. In the video below, people working with the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal discuss the importance of preserving such records. These records have been placed elsewhere for safekeeping. They are now digitally archived in the city of Girona in Spain (audio and video files) and the Swiss Federal Archives (paper files like claim documents and reference materials). This account from the Marshall Islands is among those presented at the 2015 Securing Archives at Risk conference in Bern, laying the foundation for what would later become the Safe Havens for Archives at Risk initiative.

      *Bill Graham and Cathy Debrum Wakefield, from the Marshall Islands Nuclear Tribunal, explain the importance of preserving tribunal records*#### Controversies

      As can be seen in the Marshall Islands example, a transfer of archives may be necessary in order to save unique records from destruction. This entails removing the archives from a sending institution and moving them to a receiving or hosting institution. These receiving institutions will provide a safe haven for these important archival materials. However, the transfer of archives from one country to another, no matter how well-intentioned, can be controversial. Issues about access and ownership arise, as well as the asymmetrical relationships between the sending institution and the hosting institution. In the past, archival rescue has been used as a rationale to transfer valuable artefacts from poorer countries to richer ones (Sutton, 2021, p. 87).

      In the absence of guidelines on access and return and proper documentation, it can become difficult to recover deposited materials from hosting institutions later on. This is the case for El Salvadorian archives housed in the United Nations archives, for instance. When the transfer was made, the duration was not specified, nor who was allowed to transfer the archives back to Ecuador. As a result, the records remain at the UN archives 26 years later despite Ecuador’s requests (p. 93). A set of clear guidelines prior to the transfer thus becomes necessary to address or avoid such issues. While archival rescue has been on the minds of archivists for a long time, the push to establish the necessary guidelines was crystallized in 2016.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/how-safe-havens-and-the-guiding-principles-were-developed-606" />

      ##### Safe Havens for Archives at Risk

      The Safe Havens for Archives at Risk initiative is responsible for the development of these Guidelines. The initiative is helmed by the peace research institute swisspeace. Swisspeace is mandated by the Swiss government to coordinate this initiative.

      The guidelines have been developed by an international Working Group – representatives of international and governmental institutions and NGOs that met at a congress in 2016 – that has since become an Advisory Committee in 2019.

      The Advisory Committee works on developing the topic of safe havens for at-risk archives, advising swisspeace in requests from sending institutions and helping these find suitable hosts (Safe Havens for Archives at Risk, n.d.). Explore the timeline to understand the development of this initiative and guidelines.

      ##### The Guiding Principles

      Eighteen principles were agreed upon. These “Guiding Principles for Safe Havens’” for Archives at Risk are ‘a set of principles providing guidance on archival and ethical factors to be taken into account when planning the transfer of analogue or digital archives (or copies) to another institution for safekeeping’ (Sutton, 2021, p.87). After some drafts and revisions, this is the final version:

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/18-guiding-principles-for-save-havens-for-archives-at-risk-609" />

      *These are final 18 Guiding Principles for Safe Havens for Archives at Risk (Sutton, 2021, pp. 90-91).*\

      Archiving Reproductive Health (ARH) is a Wellcome-funded project coordinated by the Digital Repository of Ireland, which is working to preserve digital material created by grassroots organisations working for reproductive justice in Ireland, especially during the 2018 referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution. To date, Archiving Reproductive Health has published collections from key organisations that were involved with the campaign, and a range of oral history interviews with feminist and reproductive rights activists working in Ireland over the last 40 years. The project will continue until the end of 2023 and the collections it creates are safely deposited in the Digital Repository of Ireland for the long term.

      The Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) is a national Trustworthy Digital Repository (TDR) for Ireland’s humanities, cultural heritage, and social sciences data. DRI has been certified by the CoreTrustSeal since 2018, building on our established role as a TDR. We support best practice in digital archiving, digital preservation, Open Access, Open Research, and FAIR data sharing. The DRI has pioneered the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in Ireland in the context of a trustworthy and certified repository for social sciences and humanities data.

      Some FAIR data policies used by DRI and ARH include: consistent application of persistent identifiers including DOIs and ORCIDs, rich and standardised metadata that is indexed and searchable, promoting the use of vocabularies, and licences for reuse. In September 2022 Archiving Reproductive Health won a Digital Preservation Award, the prestigious National Records of Scotland Award for Safeguarding the Digital Legacy. This award celebrates initiatives for the practical application of tools to protect at-risk digital objects.

      ##### Context

      ###### The Eighth Amendment

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/10e3f2d82f3095ac7a287c0e6949fb7fc8476fe6-71254.jpg)*March for Choice, 2016 by Renee Summers, taken from the front of the march, showing a row of Abortion Rights Campaign activists holding a large banner. (Source: DRI)*

      Many countries around the world have seen mobilisations of people for progressive change in recent years, and Ireland is no exception. In 2018, the Irish public voted in a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution. The Eighth Amendment, enacted by another referendum in 1983, placed a constitutional block on the right to legal abortion care in Ireland (although women in Ireland continued to travel to Britain and other places to access abortion care).

      When the referendum took place, on 25 May 2018, it passed by 66.4%, with every constituency but one returning a majority Yes vote. Together for Yes disbanded after the referendum, and the various groups focused on the implementation of legislation. In January 2019, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was enacted, making elective abortion care legal in Ireland for the first time in the nation’s history.

      In the lead-up to the referendum, there were a number of campaigns from grassroots organisations and volunteers which took place primarily over social media. In particular, a number of initiatives emerged whose aim was to tell stories of personal experiences of abortion. These collected and published stories from ordinary women, giving a voice to a previously silent group, and developing a public capacity to empathise with their experiences. One such initiative is the In Her Shoes Facebook page. Preserved in ARH’s Core Collections, In Her Shoes is particularly important to archive as it captures personal ‘hidden histories’, the silent suffering of women, the shame and stigma associated with abortion and captures a time of emerging social change.

      ###### Social justice movements and the digital

      Social justice movements in recent years rely heavily on digital content, which is vulnerable to loss and decay as physical material (in some cases more so). Moreover, there is no consensus on the best practice for archiving social media posts, hosted as they are on a variety of platforms each with their own rules about exporting and reposting content elsewhere. The rich record of how this referendum campaign unfolded, and of how volunteers and community groups contributed to the national conversation, is at real risk, therefore, of being lost to us forever as social media accounts close, platforms change or go out of business or we simply lose track of where the information exists.

      Archiving Reproductive Health intends to provide long-term preservation and access to the many at-risk archives generated by grassroots women’s reproductive health movements during the campaign. The work ARH is carrying out ensures that part of this story of Irish recent history is preserved for future generations to learn from. Those who took part in the campaign, including people who told their stories of the experience of being unable to access abortion care in Ireland, have the record of their stories and lived experience preserved and recognised. The ARH project is partially motivated by a desire to circumvent institutional 'forgetting;' which too commonly happens around grassroots social movements. We also believe that traditionally women’s organisations have largely been excluded from archives and the focus of the project is to collect and preserve women’s experiences. The research we have carried out, not only on the technical challenges, but also on the complex issues of copyright, licensing and data protection with recent digital material, will hopefully help future projects carrying out similar work.

      ##### Core Collections

      ARH is preserving collections of design and publicity material from activist groups, as well as a sequence of stories from the popular Facebook page ‘In Her Shoes’. Research data collections in the form of oral history interviews with medics, campaigners, and women’s rights activists are also collected. These provide important records of the lived experiences of activists and people affected by issues of reproductive inequality in Ireland.

      The project is continuously publishing material over the course of its operations in 2022 and 2023. Much of the material will already be familiar to the public from the 2018 referendum campaign, but the scheduled publication of administrative documents such as meeting agendas, strategic plans and annual reports gives the public richer and deeper context, as well as providing an invaluable resource for researchers. Explore the slider to get an overview of the key stakeholder organisations that ARH is collecting material from and the various collections.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/archiving-reproductive-health-stakeholders-664" />

      ###### Administrative documents

      The second tranche of published material in the ARH project focuses on publications and administrative documents created by stakeholder organisations, including reports, policy papers, and general meeting agendas and minutes from the Abortion Rights Campaign, and policy publications from Together for Yes and Terminations for Medical Reasons. The evolution of the Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment can be traced through submissions to international bodies such as the Commission for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to public consultations held by the Irish government, and through collections of testimony from ordinary people affected by the Eighth Amendment.

      ##### Additional Collections

      A number of additional collections have also been preserved as part of the ARH project. These include material by other volunteer organisations, researchers and campaigning groups.

      The voices of activists from the past are heard in a series of oral history interview transcripts, taken from interviews with reproductive rights activists in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s, crucial years for the development of the Irish pro-choice movement. These interviews were conducted by scholars and activists Linda Connolly and Mary Muldowney, and their inclusion in the Archiving Reproductive Health project adds to present and future researchers’ understanding of this period. More recent activists’ voices come from qualitative data compiled by academic Camilla Fitzsimons, from questionnaires conducted in 2015, 2020 and 2021, which provide insights into activists’ thinking on campaigning pre and post the 2018 referendum. Click on the (i)nformation icons below to learn more about the additional collections:

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/additional-collections-666" />

      ##### Public Collection Day

      Archiving Reproductive Health, in partnership with Archives Ireland and Informa, held a Public Collection Day in Dublin City Library and Archive, Pearse St, Dublin, on 10 March 2023. This event was part of the public outreach aspect of ARH, and at the event we worked to digitise a cross-section of personal memorabilia relating to the history of the Eighth Amendment, and of reproductive health in Ireland more generally, over the last few decades.Members of the public applied to take part in a one-day event in Dublin on 10 March 2023. At this event, the successful applicants brought material which was digitised on-site by expert staff from Archives Ireland and Informa, or was transferred to DRI’s servers using secure file transfer.

      DRI staff worked with applicants to collect important information about the material, which was then used for cataloguing. After the event, the digitised material is being published on DRI as part of the ARH collection, ensuring it is preserved in the long-term. Applications were open to everyone, and we sought material relating to any aspect of the history of the Eighth Amendment and the history of reproductive health and activism in Ireland more generally. Explore the dropdown for samples of the collections published from material digitised on the Collection Day:

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/public-collections-665" />

      ##### Publications and Resources

      ###### Ethics Protocol

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6152dcdea8cc31c845f5b18533215b3193d1b803-71255.png)*Photo of the first page of* *The Ethics Protocol.*

      The project team developed an 'Ethical Protocol' for the project spelling out the ethical challenges and clearly explaining our decisions to addressing each of these challenges. The purpose of the protocol are (1) to ensure the quality and integrity of our research and archiving processes, (2) to outline the ethical issues which arise from this project and provide solutions to these challenge, and (3) to ensure transparency in the project.

      The protocol was published alongside the initial launch of the collection on 8 March 2022. Secondly, in order to inform those who had posted to the Facebook page, we developed an FAQ document explaining the archiving procedure and what we are planning to do. This information was posted on the ‘In Her Shoes’ Facebook page and our website. It outlined that the posts on the page were being archived and answered the following questions: what will this mean? Why are we doing this? And what do I need to do? We have a contact email for anyone who had any questions or concerns about the project but we have not received any emails to date.

      There have been no queries or requests for the take-down of any story to date. Those who request access to the collection must agree a legal agreement on the DRI repository website (End User Agreement) which states that they must ‘agree to use the digital objects only in accordance with this End User Agreement’ and ‘ensure that full compliance with all data protection laws is observed when the digital objects, or derived material, are published or presented in a public forum.’

      ###### Guide to archiving for community groups

      ARH has also published the ‘Guide to archiving digital records for volunteer and community groups’, a resource of clear, easy to follow and accessible instructions and advice for small organisations with limited resources, enabling them to make the best use of what resources they have and to preserve a cross-section of their digital records.

      ###### ARH Researcher Self-Care Protocol

      In addition, a Self-Care Protocol for Archivists and Researchers has been developed by Dr Lorraine Grimes, the primary researcher on this project. The Self-Care Protocol includes practicalities for working with sensitive or traumatic data. It focuses on the potential to harm the researcher when working with sensitive data on reproductive health. Researchers working with collections within this project are encouraged to develop their own Self-Care protocols.

      ###### Conference presentations

      At the Archives Society of Alberta Biennal conference ‘Care for People in the Archives’ in Edmonton, Canada, Clare Lanigan and Lorraine Grimes presented ‘Developing a self-care protocol for working with potentially traumatic data: the Archiving Reproductive Health experience’. The presentation slides are below:

      ##### Introduction

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6deeb4bbb000c81b1295bcabb09c4cf0faa80107-71258.jpeg)![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/d7039708256ac6de9934bd2568d8b2276c71f837-71259.jpeg)Founded in 2016 at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing, Michigan, the Global Digital Humanities (DH) Symposium began as a forum showcasing DH projects at MSU in conversation with external keynote speakers working in the intersections of the digital humanities and global issues. Since then, the Symposium has grown to include keynote speakers and presenters from around the world, as well as a dynamic Planning Committee that comprises MSU and non-MSU affiliated individuals. Through its values and actions, the event has cultivated a community which continues to simultaneously deepen and expand.

      We are a DH community grounded in social justice ethos and praxis, reflected not only in the content of our symposia (with topics ranging from digital activism, climate justice, digital storytelling, anticolonial frameworks, feminist pedagogies, Indigenous rights, to archives and preservation), but also in the administration, planning, and execution of the Symposium itself. The ongoing and behind-the-scenes work to create the Symposium is as deeply important as the presentations and discussions featured during the event. The making of our Global DH Symposium is, in fact, a digital humanities project, an activation of social justice work, and a manifestation of digital humanities infrastructure and ecosystem.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/786b1bd0616cab5a20458980ce324fa99be5d20d-71260.jpg)\
      In this case study, we will share several areas of Symposium planning and management that exemplify the ways that we create this event and how our values are infused into the decisions and priorities that we make.

      ##### Conference-Making as Digital Humanities Work

      Conferences are critical infrastructure for the facilitation, curation and creation of knowledge through which scholarly communities coalesce to inspire and empower each other to enact positive change. Considering the centrality of conference attendance, presentation, and post-event publications to the development of the scholarly record and in determining scholarly reward, critiques of the power and structures of conferences (Eichmann-Kalwara et al. 2019; Estill et al. 2022; Nebiolo and Palermo 2019) are crucial to advancing an ethical field and holding infrastructure accountable to the community.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ce2548bd305f82ec941b19089ae651c3c353be22-71262.jpeg)*Figure 1: Presenters are located across the world (location determined by institutional affiliation at the time of presentation*\
      The labor involved in the planning, organizing and executing conferences is rarely discussed as a form of digital humanities praxis. The growing episteme of critique and reflection on how DH conferences are operationalized makes clear how “inclusive representation and community diversity” are enacted and need to be thought through and overhauled (Gao et al., 2023). In 2015, digital humanists Domenico Fiormonte, Teresa Numerico, and Francesca Tomasi envisioned that within the next ten years, the field of digital humanities would see geographic expansion and the inclusion of non-Western perspectives. That decade is nearly complete, yet their vision is yet to be achieved. DH conferences, in particular, still favor white male presenters and European-focused perspectives (Eichmann-Kalwara et al., 2019).

      ##### Social Justice as an Imperative for Digital Humanities Conference Work

      The Global DH Symposium seeks to showcase social justice-oriented and globally engaged DH works through its program while also making ethically grounded decisions in cultivating community and planning the event. With social justice as a foundation to our digital humanities conference work, we strive to make the event as global as possible. This means seriously considering what the global means in both its limitations and possibilities: understanding the problems, frictions, inequalities, and injustices that globalization brings while at the same time acknowledging the potential of a networked world made possible by digital technologies.

      While many conferences in North America, historically and traditionally speaking, reinforce the marginalization of diverse voices by centering specific kinds of perspectives (often, these tend to be male and white-centric), we intentionally set out with the commitment to creating a conference that pays attention to digital humanities works with social, cultural, and political concerns indispensable to their core. We also make it a point to highlight works that may not have received much visibility in the digital humanities field or that may not be labeled as such given the field’s uneven developments in different places, especially the “Global South.”

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/aa69afbda397f1841195bc9cfa10edadb36bbfef-71263.jpeg)*Figure 2: Social justice word frequencies in Symposium abstracts, 2016-2024*\
      As a conference community that continues to grow and learn together, we understand that social justice-oriented work is not without its challenges and is always ongoing. In an effort to adhere to our imperative of social justice, these are the key values that guide our practices.

      > *This is about some of the ways we are attempting to dream ways to access care deeply, in a way where we are in control, joyful, building community, loved, giving, and receiving, that doesn’t burn anyone out or abuse or underpay anyone in the process. - Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Care Work (2018)*

      *Figure 3: A selection of presentations from 2021-2023*##### Cultivating Community

      The Global DH Symposium community is at the heart of everything we do. To enact and sustain social justice work, one first needs community. Building community is iterative and takes time: over the nine years since the Global DH Symposium was founded, we have cultivated a strong and vibrant network of Global DH scholars and practitioners of all levels through our annual meetings. Our consistent efforts at creating community is reflected in the number of people who return to propose, present, review, and attend year after year, in addition to the influx of new participants that every annual meeting brings.

      ###### Iteration and Evolution

      Each year, we recruit new voices (reviewers and committee members) and retain existing ones in order to have longevity, as well as always to gain fresh perspectives. Our Planning Committee reflects this continuity and diversity, with some committee members being long-time participants of the Symposium and some being newer ones. For us, iteration and evolution means that we are always learning and trying to improve -- reinvention does not always have to be invention. We are not trying to dominate the field and not looking to be the largest conference in digital humanities; in fact, we have kept our conference intentionally small, allowing for experimentation and enabling deeper relations.

      ###### Equity and Inclusivity

      Over the years, we have foregrounded an ethos and praxis of care at every level of running the Symposium, from pre-Symposium planning to post-Symposium reviewing: this is a vital part of equity and inclusivity being the foundations of our programming. Practicing equity and inclusivity with care takes various forms, ranging from having a set of external reviewers to help in ethical decision-making, to implementing a non-hierarchical conference, to increasing accessibility through linguistic and time zone multiplicities, and finding creative ways of fostering community beyond presentations through activities like trivia games, especially when the COVID-19 pandemic challenged how we facilitated social interactions in our virtual conferences.

      Part of our work in equity and inclusivity is activating a feminist approach to making labor visible and known. In staying true to the roots of the meaning of collaboration, as both a working together and a word that has embedded within it the word labor, we strive to always accomplish best practices in appreciating and rewarding the contributions of everyone who makes this community and conference possible: the committee members, the reviewers, the translators, and the participants.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/4ebb8385f18e422ee6ac98348e812814af63c5ad-71264.png)*Figure 4: João Beira at the Symposium 2023 during his presentation “Merging the physical with the digital: A case study for the future of digital Art”.

      ###### Planning Committee

      Our Planning Committee is made up of a non-hierarchical group of scholars, librarians, archivists, postdocs, faculty, and undergraduate, high school, and graduate students from across and outside the United States, regardless of affiliation and position. The variety of backgrounds within the committee -- including new and rotating members -- allows for the Symposium to uphold its key values and ensures heterogeneous perspectives. As a committee with diverse sets of expertise, we work together in coming up with potential keynote presenters, brainstorming conference activities and engagement, and crafting the program. At the core, we are always aiming to improve how we enact our three key values.

      In 2021, we launched the formation of four subcommittees within the Planning Committee, with members working collaboratively through monthly virtual meetings: Content and Publications, Technology and Volunteers, Communications and Community Building, and Local Planning. Part of our evolution as planners of the Symposium has also included experimenting with different platforms (e.g., Trello, Slack, etc.) to better manage our organization and communication.

      As a global committee, we have been confronted with the following challenges: time commitment, working across time zones (US, Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.), and how to overcome practical barriers such as tax issues when sending honoraria to committee members who are not based in the United States or who have visa restrictions that restrict receiving an honorarium. The committee is a crucial component to the success of the event and serves as a nexus of community building, but supporting deep engagement is difficult amidst everyone’s limited time. Combined with the aforementioned logistical challenges, these challenges mean that we must continue to iterate to find the balance between facilitating enticing, enriching work and making the conference happen.

      ###### Making the Program

      We welcome reviewers from around the globe (in 2024, we had a total of 50 reviewers). Each year, we invite all presenters and reviewers from the previous Symposium to become involved in the community by reviewing submissions, and we open the review opportunity to members of the Global Outlook (GO:DH) community. Additionally, we invite reviewers into the program decision-making process. This opportunity gives people an on-ramp for getting more involved in the formal planning process, and it opens up the ways of conference/academic thinking to newcomers. Finally, it brings in new voices to keep our program-planning informed by expertise from around the world.

      <IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6won8itSUf4?si=HIoVMm5BS1SA6pRi" title="YouTube video player" />

      The Symposium ran using a double-anonymous review process from 2017-2023, during which time we relied on the invisible volunteer work of several dozen reviewers as well as a laborious by-hand matching system. For the 2024 Symposium, we adopted Oxford Abstracts as a system for handling submission, reviews, registration, and communication. This system allowed us to shift to an open review process and to provide reviewer feedback to submitters. The transparency afforded by the review process improved the experience for reviewers and provided valuable insight to submitters. In the words of one of our reviewers (shared anonymously through a feedback survey): “The review process was clear and transparent; the review portal was accessible and easy to follow along; and the nesting of each of these components within the overall symposium organizing was an excellent way to model an inclusive and generative space for discourse-and community-building across both geographical and disciplinary difference.”

      We engage reviewers in the program-creation process further by inviting them to the “decision-making days,” when all planning committee members and reviewers are welcome to join the virtual sessions in crafting the program and determining acceptances and rejections of submissions. Over two days, we use Zoom and an export of submissions and reviews on a Trello board, and we work through each submission together -- a human-driven and engaging (and exhausting) process of paring down the list of submissions and creating the program. Reviewers get a window into how the Planning Committee works and gain a sense of transparency and agency in their relationship with the Symposium through this opportunity. For the Planning Committee, we benefit from these additional perspectives and voices as we make decisions toward final implementation of the program.

      ###### Multilingualism

      The pandemic prompted a major shift for the Symposium in many ways. After recovering from our lightspeed pivot to Zoom in March 2020, the planning committee investigated what opportunities an all-virtual conference could provide. Up to that point, the conference had always been exclusively in English. Given the value we place on building a global community, this was a significant limitation. However, with a conference entirely on Zoom, we could leverage the platform’s interpretation features and put funds freed up from travel and catering expenses towards hiring interpreters.

      At the time, there were few conferences that were conducted in multiple languages. DH2020 in Ottawa was intended to be multilingual but had been canceled due to the pandemic. We reached out to our DH community and our local community at MSU with the goal of finding collaborators. We strove to find people we could learn from so that we could support our interpreters in their work while staying within our budget. We connected with Melissa Jameson, a professional Spanish-English interpreter who was instrumental in guiding us through the process of building multilingual infrastructure. She helped us understand the norms and best practices of the field and gave us a roadmap for how to support our other interpreters.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/2-ethical-lens-670" />

      *Figure 5: The proceedings website showcases presentation materials across presentation languages and types*\
      Since then, each year the planning committee has reflected and iterated the (often imperfect) ways we support multilingualism at the Symposium. Since the first year, we have supported interpretation between Spanish and English. For the first two years of our multilingual endeavor, we also supported French-English interpretation with an eye towards supporting scholars on the African continent. However, over the course of those two years, we received very few proposals in French and little indication that participants were tuning into the French language channel in Zoom. It became clear that French wasn’t expanding our reach in the ways we had hoped. In 2022, we decided to experiment with supporting Mandarin Chinese after hearing that the Symposium was promoted on WeChat in Chinese-speaking DH circles. However, Chinese proved to be a more challenging language to build infrastructure for. We had fewer connections to speakers in that community and relied on relative newcomers to the field. While we were happy to provide opportunities for new interpreters to gain valuable experience, our small team needed to put in too much labor for the quality of translation, especially considering the low demand for it that we were seeing. We made the difficult decision to make the 2024 Symposium bilingual in Spanish and English only, with the plan of deepening our engagement with Spanish-language DH communities.

      ###### Running the Event

      As a one-of-its-kind DH symposium, we are committed to planting and growing the seeds of transformative, emerging, and nascent Global DH work in the world. To that end, our presentations are all plenary -- not only does this allow for greater visibility and equity, making the sessions plenary also means increased engagement and collegiality. When the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shift to a virtual event, we also provided human-created captioning.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0e50925e9f634d9de47aaad32c72a4a778662612-71265.jpg)*Figure 6: Screenshot of Tweet acknowledging Trivia winner from 2022 Virtual Symposium*\
      The Symposium has always – and will always – offer free registration. For in-person days (the Symposium was entirely in-person from 2016-2019 and has returned to offering an in-person day since 2023), we take seriously the role that hospitality, space, and tone play in building community during a conference, so we work to offer low-cost to no-cost accommodation, provide delicious food to suit all dietary needs, and build comfortable spaces for conference discussion. The in-person event has also always been live-streamed, so that the work of presenters can be shared more widely. The Global DH Symposium, therefore, functions as a global and local event, with a priority on an ethics of welcome and openness as our guiding principle.

      *Figure 7: Slide to reveal the physical location of the Global DH Symposium and souvenirs for face-to-face attendees.* ##### Cultivating Artifacts of Global DH Work

      Conference presentation is a valuable component of scholarly activity, but it can be ephemeral. For this reason, the Symposium provides infrastructure for presenters to contribute their work to a more persistent scholarly record. Since the first Symposium in 2016, we have shared recordings of presentations that were live-streamed with the aim that those artifacts serve to amplify the work of the scholars and support their continued life in the field. In 2021, we launched proceedings on Humanities Commons, using its features as a public website and a subject repository to encourage discovery. In November and December 2023, we released a double special issue of Reviews in Digital Humanities to showcase 8 projects that were part of the 2023 Symposium, and we anticipate future collaborations with the Reviews in DH journal.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ethical-lens-3-671" />

      *Figure 8: The eight projects presented in the special issues of Reviews of Digital Humanities*\
      In celebration of the 10th Symposium in 2025, we will launch a Global Digital Humanities journal as a publication venue for global DH work writ large. This journal will be an open and inclusive space, offering translation across languages and across cultural contexts (Ortega 2019), and opening possibilities for scholarly visibility and reward.

      ##### Conclusion

      In keeping with the meaning of symposium (a lively gathering for conversation, drinking, and intellectual discussion), we are deliberate about creating a joyful, affirmative, and generative space for sharing ideas, projects, and knowledge, for this is also what our ongoing work as a global DH team committed to social justice means. A community, a digital humanities project, a pedagogical resource, and a global event -- this is the ever-growing, ever-evolving Global Digital Humanities Symposium.

      ‘Intersectionality' (race, gender, class) can as shown in Unit I be seen as entanglements of inequity, which can not be approached in siloed ways. Sex and gender issues typically cannot be understood without considering race and class, and race and class cannot be understood unless we acknowledge that our practices, unfolding through knowledge technologies and systems, also imply knowledge paradigms vested in long histories of coloniality, the structures of which continue to prevail. Thus, we must approach such entanglements of knowledge inequality much the same way that we approach other complex problems, e.g. anthropocene entanglements. Of the latter Donna Haraway has famously advised to ‘stay with the trouble’ and do knowledge work through ‘string figures’ (Haraway, 2016; Museum Fatigue, 2020).

      We know string figure games as the children’s game of ‘cat’s cradle’, played with a loop of string or yarn in rounds of pattern making – from one pair of hands to the next. String figure games are found all over the world and the technique is the same, but the patterns differ and the way Haraway reference string figures as patterns we weave together, in so many ways covers what we are practicing in this course – in order to stay with the trouble of social justice in knowledge production – by adding in ideas, theories, stories, practices from projects and places across the world in a continuous weaving, recognizing that we can no longer claim linear or privileged pathways to universal knowledge. When speaking of na’atl’o’, the Navajo string games, Haraway writes:

      > These string figures are thinking as well as making practices, pedagogical practices and cosmological performances. Some Navajo thinkers describe string games as one kind of patterning for for restoring hózhó, a term imperfectly translated into English as “harmony”, “beauty”, “order”, and “right relations to the world,.” It matters which ideas we think other ideas with \[my italics] my thinking or making cat’s cradle with na’atl’o’ is not an innocent universal gesture, but a risky proposition in relentless historical contingency. And these contingencies include abundant histories of conquest, resistance, recuperation, and resurgence. (Haraway 2016, 14-15)

      Our knowledge institutions, knowledge systems and the way we manage them are more often than not considered universal and objective. However, from the perspective of the history of science, our knowledge institutions, knowledge systems and technologies as well as the practices put in place for knowledge production reveal entanglements of embedded coloniality, racialisation, gender inequality and class distinction which pervade the discourse of universalism and the structures of ‘objectivism’. Intersectional issues and entanglements are structural and lie deep in our institutions and our systems and practices, and unless we become aware we will, unconsciously, reproduce historical biases through inherited and biased knowledge systems and technologies in the claim of universal knowledge. So, to start thinking with others as proposed in the image of string figures, we need to consider and disrupt this idea of universal and objective knowledge – and its foundation in a particular paradigm of knowledge, which gained hegemony over hundreds of years of colonialism, suppressing other knowledge systems, as part of colonization of territories and peoples.

      ###### 1.Coloniality, Local histories, Ecologies of Knowledge

      The definition of science and the knowledge paradigm we know and practice within European/Western Culture began in the 15th Century and has often been attributed to the European Renaissance and the revival of classics – philosophy, poetry, poetics, and mathematics – much of which came to us through translation of Greek manuscripts, retrieved from Arabian libraries. But, our knowledge paradigm is also unthinkable without the European colonizing powers going towards the East, the West and the South, creating a sourcing network of knowledge items structured around power, and consequently developing knowledge institutions such as universities and academies, libraries, museums and archives as a result of colonial exploitation and trade. ‘Data’, documents, and artifacts gradually accumulated at these Western centers of knowledge, building over time an institutional framework which made it easier to accumulate more.

      > \[...] during the period 1500 to 2000, one local history, that of Western civilization, built itself as the point of arrival and owner of human history. Ownership was expressed by building a system of knowledge as if it were the guardian of all knowledges, past and present \[...] (Mignolo 2012, x)

      Western epistemic, economic, political and cultural hegemony was possible because the construction and management of knowledge was in the hands and heads of European actors, in European languages and supported by European institutions. ‘Westerncentrism of knowledge’ means that sustainable knowledge was cast in six modern European imperial languages based on Greek and Latin. This is not a geographical but an epistemic concept. (Mignolo 2013, 10)

      Walter Mignolo, author of Local Histories/Global Designs (2000/2012), The Politics of Decolonial Investigations (2021) and co-author with Catherine E. Walsh of On Decoloniality. Concepts, Analytics, Praxis (2018) has vastly theorized the concept of decoloniality as an ontological and epistemological concept. This concept, which gradually over the past few decades, has encouraged us to more broadly think of knowledge and knowledge systems as not being universal, but rooted in local histories and epistemes, countering a colonial history that over a period of more than 500 years hegemonized the many knowledges of those living in coloniality, in the image of Western civilization. Mignolo argues that coloniality is the dark side of modernity, and that Western epistemic hegemony of the spheres of culture, knowledge, aesthetics, and sensibility – caused not only other (kinds of) knowledge to be muted, but also was instrumental in the disappearance of local knowledge (epistemicide) – that has been a significant driver of Western political and economic expansion.

      What Mignolo understands as ‘Global Designs’ are a direct result of Western civilizations and coloniality suppressing local histories and causing epistemicide. This has been undertaken and “disguised with the rhetoric of modernity, of salvation and progress.” (Mignolo 2012, xvi) . As a remedy Mignolo proposes ‘border thinking’ which is thinking and doing knowledge while staying in the border. Epistemic borders open in moments when the imaginary of modernity - in the spheres of culture, knowledge, aesthetics – cracks to reveal its Janus-faced darker side of coloniality. Such moments of border thinking allow us to acknowledge a plethora of local perspectives within the same border, “not only what is visible in the ‘ground’, but what has been hidden from view in the ‘underground’ by successive layers mapping people and territories” (Mignolo 2012, 24). Border thinking is an actional epistemic approach, it may be multidisciplinary but is seldom solely academic, as it goes beyond or is delinked from disciplinary territorialities, aiming at “doing decoloniality” and changing structurally the perimeters of knowledge.

      Border thinking with local histories takes other tools than what we find within Western knowledge institutions. It is a structural disruption of the paradigm which went from Western knowledge centers to the East, South, and to the Americas in a dispersal of the institutional paradigms which became one of the backbones of coloniality. For intersectional communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, information retrieval through existing knowledge systems is often an experience of being made invisible reinforcing the experiences of such communities as being undervalued as legitimate sources of knowledge, and ones that cannot provide unique insights into interconnecting systems of social and colonial injustice. This is where colonialism and hundreds of years of knowledge extraction and epistemicide by colonizing powers have turned into coloniality as a legacy of long-standing patterns of power that still define sociocultural and economic structures and relations, as well as knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations.

      > Coloniality survives colonialism. It is maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic performance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image of peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects of our modern experience. In a way, as modern subjects we breathe coloniality all the time and every day (Maldonado-Torres 2007, 243)

      While the struggles for decolonization characterized many of the 20th Centuries social justice movements claiming equality, decolonial thinkers take these struggles towards the liberation from coloniality as power structures of knowledge, identity, and being – including institutions such as universities.

      Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni, author of Epistemic Freedom in Africa (2018), has prominently theorized the conceptual and actual power structures and border zones between the epistemologies of colonialism, coloniality, and practices of decoloniality in academia and beyond:

      > As an epistemological movement, it has always been overshadowed by hegemonic Euro-North American-centric intellectual thought and social theories. As a political movement, it has consistently been subjected to surveillance of global imperial designs and colonial matrices of power. But today, decoloniality is remerging at a time when the erstwhile hegemonic Euro-North American-centric modernity and its dominant epistemology are experiencing an epistemological break. This epistemic break highlights how Euro-North American-centric modernity has created modern problems of which it has no modern solutions and how theories/knowledges generated from a Euro-North American-centric context have become exhausted if not obstacles to the understanding of contemporary human issues. (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2015, 485)

      In 2022, Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni contributed to a series of twelve video-interviews on Decolonial Thinking, in the ninth interview, on Ecologies of Knowledge, African Archive, Ndlovu-Gatsheni states amongst other that decolonizing 'means that we change the archive, from which we draw, and that also means that we recover that which has been displaced. We need to remember what has been dismembered \[...] Therefore we need to look for other knowledges to rescue ourselves from the epistemic crises we find ourselves in. \[...] One knowledge system from one civilization is no longer adequate.' (4:13)

      <IframeElement w={640} h={360} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzXfNm-i38U?si=NOp-bONpX4kxFrvM" title="YouTube video player" />

      In the interview above, Ndlovu-Gatsheni also talks of the emergence of “ecologies of knowledge”,\
      that recovering local knowledges which have displaced, means putting them towards remedying\
      the epistemic crisis brought on by the institutional hegemony of Western-centric knowledge.

      According to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Western-centric knowledge

      > is no longer adequate to the problems the world is facing therefore we need to look for other knowledges so that we rescue ourselves from the systemic and epistemic crisis we are in. So it is in this context, you draw from Islamic knowledge, you draw from African knowledge, you draw from Indian knowledge, you draw from indigenous peoples knowledge. \[...] It means that the problems facing humanity are so sophisticated that one knowledge system from one civilisation is no longer adequate. (4:58)

      ###### 2. Changing the Archive: Who Studies, Whom Is Studied

      Unit III is our contribution to highlight how interventions into specific aspects of existing knowledge systems and technologies can reveal less linear, but more ‘complete’ epistemic systems and production which are similar in practice to string figuring across knowledges and border thinking, opening ecologies of knowledge towards the systemic entanglements of coloniality and intersectionality. In this way, historians of the history of science, such as Donna Haraway may speak about disrupting ‘violent hierarchies’, particularly about who has the opportunity to study and whom is studied.

      Let us start with the question of how embodied knowledge of exclusion or tokenization is a significant and situated knowledge, pointing to the sensitivity towards lived experience as a knowledge form (Mignolo) when approaching structural exclusion from knowledge spaces. This question is about what counts as knowledge, as well as acknowledging situated points of view within the idea of rational knowledge and that the object of knowledge can turn into a subject of knowledge. In her seminal essay, “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House,” (Sister Outsider, 1984) intersectional feminist and poet activist Audre Lorde, asked, “What does it mean when tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of the same patriarchy?”. And then she answers: “It means that only the most narrow perimeters of change are possible and allowable.” Lorde wrote her essay after having been invited as a speaker to an academic conference in 1979, only to find herself the token Black Feminist and Lesbian Artist in a diversity panel. Issues of tokenism mistaken for representation, as experienced in the public spaces of knowledge production, is where intersectional inequality is ‘felt’ in an embodied way. Frantz Fanon wrote about this in Black Skin, White Masks (1952) in which Fanon analyzes and relates the lived experiences of being Black. Fanon’s phenomenological approach is adopted by Sara Ahmed in “The phenomenology of whiteness” (2007) in which she takes such experiences into an analysis of institutional spaces:

      > After all, institutions provide collective or public spaces. When we describe institutions as ‘being’ white (institutional whiteness), we are pointing to how institutional spaces are shaped by the proximity of some bodies and not others: white bodies gather, and cohere to form the edges of such spaces. When I walk into university meetings that is just what I encounter. Sometimes I get used to it. \[...] Whiteness is only invisible for those who inhabit it, or those who get so used to its inhabitance that they learn not to see it, even when they are not it. (Ahmed 2007, 157).

      Another point made by Sara Ahmed, in On Being Included (2012) is that meager representation is still an issue in knowledge institutions and even if these institutions have equipped themselves with diversity officers and committees, ‘commitment to diversity’ remains symbolic or ‘non-performative’, as the institutional commitments do not bring about what they name. On Being Included is based on Ahmed’s interviews with diversity workers and practitioners in higher education institutions and on her own work as a diversity officer. One conclusion to be drawn from Ahmed’s empirical work in On Being Included is that diversity counts as an institutional value proposition, but that representation is not how inequality and exclusion are solved structurally. Much the same point for another seminal branch of knowledge capacity building, the field of library and information studies (LIS) in the US, has been put forward by Sofia Y. Leung and Jorge R. López-McKnight, editors of Knowledge Justice. Disrupting Library and Information Studies through Critical Race Theory (2021):

      > Like most other fields, library and information studies (LIS) has framed the race problem as one of diverse representation of racialized bodies, rather than one of racial power, domination, and privilege. \[...] This understanding lacks a critical understanding of racial power and how it operates in the field, which is unsurprisingly considered how radical justice efforts centered on race have materialized in the US society. (Leung and López-McKnight 2021, 2)

      In her 1988 book, Situated Knowledges, Donna Haraway offers a critique of the existing science paradigm introducing the notion of ‘situated knowledges’, which is also embodied knowledge, to replace scientific objectivism. This seminal text was part of Haraway’s feminist (and activist) critique of Reaganist politics and the exclusion of intersectional and embodied experiences as pathways to knowledge:

      > I am arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, positioning, and situating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims. These are claims on people's lives. I am arguing for the view from a body, always a complex, contradictory, structuring, and structured body, versus the view from above, from nowhere, from simplicity. Only the god trick is forbidden. (Haraway 1988, 589)

      Haraway argues that claims for universal knowledge and disembodied objectivity is the hyper-bias of western knowledge systems which she finds schrouded in metaphors of abstract vision – also described as knowledge from “the point of view of the unmarked \[...] the master, the Man, the One God (Haraway 1988, 587). In the place of the ‘god trick’ of indifferent objectivism, Haraway argues for a clearly positioned and responsible knowledge production where what has counted as ‘objects’ for science, may become actors of situated insights. Haraway in no way discards rational science, rather, she calls for a new rationale by pointing to scientific abstraction and disembodiment - one might add ‘disengagement’ or indifference - to this hyper-bias, which has guided the West for hundreds of years with the consequence of excluding the partial, the embodied, the limited or muted voices, the powerless: what we may recognise as the communities being robbed of the knowledge which entered science as objects, as artifacts, becoming collections and specimens to be studied:

      > We seek not the knowledges ruled by phallogocentrism (nostalgia for the presence of the one true Word) and disembodied vision. We seek those ruled by partial sight and limited voice – not partiality for its own sake but, rather, for the sake of the connections and unexpected openings situated knowledges make possible. Situated knowledges are about communities, not about isolated individuals. The only way to find a larger vision is to be somewhere in particular. (Haraway 1988, 590)

      Knowledge institutions create and sustain knowledge systems. This is also true with our technical knowledge infrastructures, our digital and software interactions with resources, as well as with fellow knowledge seekers and creators of these systems. Digital information systems provide library and archival services, virtual knowledge environments and labs, digital infrastructures. As it goes for analogue spaces, we also experience virtual or digital spaces as excluding certain bodies and knowledges and as such un-consciously biasing research, education and social innovation when moving further into a digital transition.

      Social Justice principles applied to knowledge systems such as archives, libraries, databases, and infrastructures go beyond issues of representation and towards critical interactions and interventions. The epistemicide of colonized and excluded cultures and the hierarchies of who studies and whom is studied, are embedded in knowledge institutions throughout the West – from the physical institution in terms of how objects and collections have been displayed, cataloged, and described, to new digital infrastructures in terms of the metadata standards utilized to the search systems providing access. In his 2006-article “Introducing critical race theory to archival discourse”, Anthony W. Dunbar suggests a number of ‘disrupting’ approaches when introducing Critical Race Theory to unearth biases in archives, from researching counter-stories to official documentation and searching for micro-aggressions across the system of appraisal of archival records. Dunbar is looking for “ the sensibility and consciousness \[...] to explain cultural contexts beyond traditional institutional perspectives'' and to acknowledge \[...] that institutional memory is a negotiated space with multiple points of interpretation” (Dunbar 2006, 117).

      > \[...] the records continuum model suggests that when a record is created, it establishes at least two identities, that of the documenter (or records creator) and the documented (the subject of the record). At this point, it should be clear that both the documenter and the documented have different perspectives or vantage points of the ‘‘transaction’’ that a record is documenting. As a result it is also possible that the differing perspectives can constitute a development of different realities. In some cases, there may be differing if not conflicting documentation because those who are documented can have institutionally-created or self-created records of the same transactions that the documenter has recorded. (Dunbar 2006, 124)

      To Dunbar, the aim of introducing critical race theory to archival discourse (and consequently, archival practices) is one of democratizing archives from a structural point of view, in providing “an opportunity to discuss records multi-dimensionally as products, such as recordkeeping vehicles and artifacts of evidence, as well as processes, namely transactions and identity development” (Dunbar 2006,124). This approach is based on the assumption that records can be made to provide multiple dimensions, if the aforementioned power structure of ‘who studies’ and ‘whom is studied’ is recognized as an imbalance between the records creator and the subject of the record which can be disrupted.

      Unit III will, as the other units in our Social Justice in the Digital Humanities course, offer a number of case studies highlighting new knowledge practices, going beyond or disrupting a Western knowledge paradigm, as well as its history of gathering ‘objects’ for study and for building the institutions themselves around stored artifacts, specimens, and data.

      Humanities scholarship has been moving into a more interdisciplinary and hybrid direction. Collaborations between researchers in different fields, and the combination of traditional methods of engaging with or preserving data with new digital methods, can result in new insights. Here we look at the case of Walking the Archive of District Six, a joint project between the University of Cape Town and University of Michigan. Through this case, we illustrate how interdisciplinary research, new technologies and methods can play a role in education and in surfacing individual and community memories that were subjected to forced removal, in turn becoming a tool to advance social justice in the humanities.

      ##### District Six

      District Six was a densely populated working-class area in Cape Town’s inner-city. It initially developed slowly during the time of colonial (Dutch and British) occupation, and following the abolition of slavery in the 1830’s, there was a growing need for urban housing. A multiracial and multicultural community developed over a period of time, and was spurred on by massive immigration and economic growth. District Six, with its close links to both the port and business district, was an obvious place of development, and later, inner-city decay. In contrast to the growing racialisation of the rest of the country, District Six developed into a community that was cosmopolitan and respected diversity. In one sense, it was a living example of the ‘rainbow nation’ that post-apartheid South Africans would romantically wish for themselves (Soudien, 2021).

      In the 1940’s the Cape Town city council planned to demolish buildings in District Six under slum clearance, but it was only during the Apartheid era that this happened. Following the rise to power of the racist Afrikaner National Party in 1948, the policy of Apartheid was introduced. Apartheid was an ideology that institutionalised racial segregation by means of laws, such as the Population Registration Act, 1950.

      By this law, people were classified and registered according to their racial group. Overall, the white minority subjugated people of colour, enforcing nearly half a century of brutal racial oppression. By means of the Group Areas Act, District Six was declared a Whites-only area in 1966, and the demolitions began in 1968. This marked the beginning of the forced removal of approximately 60,000 Black individuals from District Six between 1968 and 1983. Families’ homes and businesses were demolished by the state’s bulldozers, and by the mid 1980’s, District Six was mostly vacant land. Today, District Six still has vast swathes of vacant land, but some people are slowly being returned by means of a process of restitution.

      An interdisciplinary project: District Six archives, memories, geographic data

      In the project ‘Walking the Archive of District Six: Memory, Augmented Reality and Counter-Surveying’, scholars David A. Wallace and Siddique Motala combine their expertise in archives and geomatics to help recover these memories and promote social justice.

      Dr David A. Wallace is a clinical associate professor based at the School of Information at the University of Michigan. His work focuses on how archives shape or misshape our construction of the past and present, accountability in recordkeeping, archival social justice, freedom of information and more, with projects spanning the US, South Africa and Rwanda. Dr Siddique Motala is a senior lecturer based in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Cape Town. His interests lie in the fields of geomatics, historical mapping, digital storytelling in education, with a special interest in decolonization efforts. He is known for his work on mapping the site of District Six and his collaborations with the District Six Museum, filmmakers and other scholars. Presenting at the 2022 Global DH Symposium, the authors summarized their project:

      > *“We wanted to virtually reconstruct District Six in terms of the lost built environment and stories of still-living ex-residents and their experiences before, during, and after demolition” (Wallace & Motala, 2022)*

      *Interview with Dr David A. Wallace and Dr Siddique Motalla about the making of the project.*

      Since 2018, they have been collaborating to bring to light the memories of people forced out of District Six. They started by combing through baptismal records from St Mark’s Anglican church, one of the few historical District Six structures still standing. They also worked with former District Six residents who provided oral accounts and personal records. Information extracted from these sources, combined with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) mapping helped researchers identify the precise locations of addresses on the present-day landscape. These were plotted on a GIS map, virtually reconstructing the demolished environment.

      Furthermore, in 2019, this joint project identified key landmarks through oral histories of survivors and records from the District Six Museum. These landmarks, which included schools, social centres, places of worship and cinemas, were likewise plotted on the GIS map. This would later become an online interactive experience on the District Six Museum website: the interactive map on the St Mark’s Memory Mapping Project.

      ##### New methods and new technologies

      Motala has also developed a walking-as-research (Motala and Bozalek, 2022) methodology called “counter-surveying.” This involves using GIS data to determine and mark locations of demolished homes and establishments, as well as walking with people connected to the sites. In the Global DH conference, Motala remarks on the need for decolonizing education, stating that he developed Counter-Surveying in an attempt to “conscientise CPUT students to the socio-political-historical aspects of the site that their university was situated on” (Wallace & Motala, 2022, para. 13). This method helps recover the stories of people who used to live there and applies geomatics in “new ways that challenge the silencing and erasure of Black people” (Wallace & Motala, 2022, para. 13).

      In addition, Motala has been taking groups on walking tours of District Six. The tours include analog maps and photos that visitors can use to compare the current environment to what it used to be. Motala and Wallace believe that such walking tours of District Six can be made better through the use of technology. Since 2022, they have been working on a walking tour app that incorporates augmented reality technologies to guide users on walks of District Six. Through this app, visitors will be led to the exact locations of demolished homes and establishments. They will be shown what used to exist there through digitized and born-digital still images, audio, and videos. Visitors can be simultaneously immersed in the present and the past.

      ##### Conclusion

      Interdisciplinary projects such as ‘Walking the Archive of District Six’ are important in advancing decolonial practices. In this case, they relate to social justice in engineering, archival science, and education. The project aims to recover the memories of the District Six community in Cape Town by using primary sources in tandem with emerging digital technologies and counter-surveying to shed light on former residents’ experiences before, during and after the removals. In drawing attention to the stories of District Six, the project brings forth issues of racism, forced displacement, neo-colonial planning practices and the continued contestations around social memory, history, and land ownership. Overall, this project works to challenge the silencing and erasure of black lives during and after the Apartheid regime. The work of Wallace and Motala could be applied to similar contexts of forced removal, reclaimed and debated memory and continued justice seeking.

The label was changed accordingly.*#### 1. Introduction

      In room 1.18 in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam hangs the portrait of a young girl holding a fan. The label reads: *Isabella, Simon Maris, c. 1906.*\
      Until a few years ago, this painting was called *Young Negro-Girl*, with the model described as ‘East Indian’ or ‘Little Negress’. In 2015, the Rijksmuseum combed through the digitized labels of 220,000 artworks for racist words used by Europeans such as ‘negro’, ‘dwarf’, ‘Mohammedan’ and more. Racially charged language was removed and the descriptions improved. It was the first museum in Europe to do so (Siegal, 2015).

      Soon after, the Rijksmuseum would embark on an exhibition on slavery which opened in 2021\[1].Four years in the making, *Slavery: Ten True Stories* was the first major exhibition about slavery for the Dutch National Museum. It was also the first time that stories of slavery across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were to be told in one exhibition in the Netherlands. While the onsite exhibit at the Rijksmuseum lasted for a few weeks, the richly illustrated digital stories of Slavery and related media can be experienced on the Rijksmuseum website.

      ###### 1.1 The legacy of slavery

      Enduring social issues such as racism and discrimination in the Netherlands have been attributed to slavery. In the past, ‘black people were enslaved by white people because they were Black’, says historical novelist Cynthia McLeod from Suriname, in an interview for the book companion of the Rijksmuseum Slavery exhibit (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2021, 303). Europeans who took part in slavery, she explains, ascribed Black people animal features, describing them as having low intelligence and no emotions in order to justify their activities. Race theories from the 18th and 19thcenturies also claimed that race is arranged on a vertical line with the white race on top, providing justification on white people’s domination and abuses of Africans and Asians. McLeod concludes, ‘This is racism. Slavery has been abolished, but that thinking still exists’ (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2021, 304)

      There is also increasing awareness of how the prosperity the Dutch enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, came at a cost. The wealth made during the Dutch Golden Age came in part from slavery and the exploitation of indigenous people and their land. As part of the transatlantic slave trade from the 16th to 19th centuries, the Dutch shipped more than 600,000 slaves from West Africa to Europe and the Americas. Moreover, profits from sugar and spices powered by slave labour in Dutch colonies, created wealth for the Dutch. Enslaved people who resisted their captors were tortured and killed. Although slavery was abolished in the Netherlands in 1644, it remained legal in the colonies until 1863.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/rijks-legacy-of-slavery-627" />

      Looking into the legacy of this history has become more urgent. Since the Black Lives Matter movement was (re-)ignited in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the USA, similar protests calling attention to racism have spread to the Netherlands. There have been incidents of colonial statues in the country being defaced.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/62498a637e0fa48a5cc4f1de3cae6286194bf8c6-71330.jpeg)![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b3688ee2874ae48e26ac492a717be73b4c1696df-71331.jpg)\*Black Lives Matter protest in Zwolle, the Netherlands in 2020 (Source: @Gemeente\_Zwolle, X)\**Zwarte Piet (‘Black Pete'), the companion of Saint Nicholas who provides candy to well-behaved children on the Feast of St Nicholas.

      Repeated criticisms have come from the public for practices deemed racist. These include outcries on the royal family’s use of the Golden Carriage that contains racist imagery, and the painting of blackface by people playing Zwarte Piet on St Niklaas Day. Official apologies for the country’s role in slavery came in 2022 and 2023, first from the Prime Minister Mark Ruitte, and then from the King of the Netherlands, His Majesty King Willem-Alexander.

      ###### 1.2 Response

      More is being done beyond issuing official apologies. The Dutch government and institutions are re-examining Dutch history and the legacy of slavery. In the case of the Rijksmuseum, they recognised that the history of slavery has not yet been studied by the museum in depth nor is it reflected in how their collection is presented. This is despite slavery being a part of national history, ‘a living past for many people beyond its walls’ (Sint Nicolaas et al. 2020, 9). There is also an understanding that more work needs to be done to create a more holistic account of history. Colonial archives, records left by the wealthy and literate, tend to reduce the enslaved to numbers, describe them in denigrating terms and take away their humanity. The enslaved are included in the archives in bills of sale, interrogation transcripts, and records of complaints and punishments. These records reflect the perspective of the colonial rulers.

      ##### 2. *Slavery: Ten True Stories* at the Rijksmuseum

      As a way to create a counter-narrative, from 2017 to 2021, the Rijksmuseum worked on *Slavery*, an exhibit that offered an unflinching look at how slavery is intertwined with Dutch history, as well as the museum’s own collection. The approach for *Slavery* was to tell the history of slavery not through abstract concepts such as numbers and dates; instead, the exhibition focused on the personal stories of ten people whose lives were touched by slavery. These people suffered from slavery, fought against it, or were people who profited from it. These ten individuals came from the Netherlands, as well as Brazil, Suriname, the Caribbean, South Africa and Asia, from countries that had been under Dutch colonial rule.

Some were items never before displayed, including plantation tools and objects cherished by enslaved people. An audio guide was created to accompany the exhibit, and for this, a deliberate choice was made to privilege narrators who were connected in some way to the 10 featured individuals through geography, familial relations, who were descendants of the enslaved people, or have worked to bring their stories to light.

      For instance, the story of Wally, an enslaved person who worked on a plantation in Suriname, is narrated by Surinamese-Dutch athlete Remy Bonjasky. Remy’s ancestors worked on the same plantation as Wally. Meanwhile, the story of Lohkay, an enslaved woman from Sint Maarten is narrated by musician-educator Anastacia Larmonie. Born in Curacao but raised by parents from Sint Maarten, Anastacia grew up listening to Lohkay’s stories and now creates music about her and other warriors like her. While experiencing the physical exhibition, visitors could also listen to these narratives, as well as oral sources, songs and chants. Through the embedded aurality, visitors could be brought closer to the emotions and experiences of enslaved people as the vast majority were not permitted to write, and hence record their experience. Below are some of the pieces featured in the exhibit.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/rijks-people-behind-the-audio-narratives-628" />

      Two years after the exhibition closed in The Netherlands, in February 2023, the exhibition was featured at the United Nations Headquarters in New York as a capsule collection. At the time of writing (July 2023), it is at the UN Office in Geneva as a poster presentation. *Slavery: Ten True Stories* endures as an online exhibition on the Rijksmuseum website.

      ##### 3. The digital afterlife of *Slavery: Ten True Stories*

      While the physical *Slavery* exhibition at the Rijksmuseum was available for public viewing for two months, it has a lasting online presence \[2]. The opening of the physical exhibit was accompanied by the release of the online exhibition *Slavery* - online resources that became especially important in engaging the public, as *Slavery’s* opening coincided with closures of public venues in the Netherlands. Far from being an inventory of digitised artefacts from the physical exhibit, Slavery online features four areas to explore: richly-illustrated multimedia stories on the ten individuals (‘The 10 people’), Animations, a video feature on the La Bouche du Roi installation, and a recording of the symposium on Sources on Slavery.

      ###### 3.1 Multimodal storytelling

      *The 10 People* multimedia stories first take the visitor on a mini virtual tour. Each starts with a 3D view of the museum space dedicated to the person, as a voiceover briefly introduces the gallery and the historical context. The camera pans around this space, introducing the pieces within, the layout and the museum design. If the video is paused, the visitor is able to change their viewpoint by clicking and dragging their cursor, or use the zoom functions +/- on the right to examine the pieces or the museum environment more closely. After this 3D mini tour, the narrator is introduced; they explain their connection to the person and begin to tell their story.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/45ec8c6ef68cf47c20b18bed012fc87c313b7efe-71336.png)*3D experience: 'The story of Surapati'\
      Click on the play button to explore.*\
      The narration, the same as those on the accompanying audio guide for the physical visit, layers on top of visuals such as drawings and photos of the objects, paintings, or archival documents.

      If the video is paused, the visitor can likewise zoom in and out of the photos, or drag them to the sides with their cursors, enabling them to see more details. Apart from the voiceover and visual elements, music and chants also feature in the storytelling. (For some individuals, there are cartoon video animations in the Animations section of the online exhibit

      ###### 3.2 Online symposium on inclusive sources and interdisciplinary collaboration

      Drawing from a variety of sources was important to prevent reproducing the power dynamic found in historical records and to tell stories from the perspective of the enslaved. This topic was the focus of the international online symposium *Sources on Slavery and Slave Trade* organized by the Rijksmuseum, the National Archives of the Netherlands and the National Library of the Netherlands. The symposium was held on April 23, 2021 (before the exhibit opening), but it is available for replay on the *Slavery* exhibition website and has become part of its enduring online presence. In the symposium, researchers and professionals reflected on the importance of inclusive use of sources for museums, archives and libraries. Explore the slider below to see some of these sources discussed in the symposium, the ones that contributed to the *Slavery* exhibit.

      *Various sources/ data points beyond written records are included in the exhibition. Click on the hotspots to learn more.*\
      In the symposium, the experts on the panel also discussed issues around making sensitive data about slavery more accessible through digitisation and open access. Dutch historian Karwan Fatah-Black from Leiden University noted that the abundance of digital sources make it possible to ‘ask more questions, to ask different questions, and try out new methods in the way we do this history’ (1h.48m.30s). Digitisation also makes it possible ‘to connect these different archives and to make more complete and fuller stories…that have been hidden by history before’ (1h.49m.00s). Meanwhile, Dutch historian from Radboud University Coen van Galen, discussed how having open, easily accessible digital sources (such as digitised slave registers) was a ‘great way to democratise the study of slavery’ (1h.54m.30s). He further highlighted the public impact of these easily accessible digital sources, for example by providing inspiration for plays people talk about, reaching ‘even those strands of the population who never would do anything with slavery’ (1h.55m.00s). Bondan Kanuyomoso, Lecturer and Researcher at the University of Indonesia, noted how open digital archives can give students direct access to primary sources, when previous interactions with the past could have been through history books (3h.19m.50s). Online access was especially important during the pandemic, when people were not able to access archives in person.

      Keynote speaker Marisa Fuentes, a historian at Rutgers University, warned that although ‘digitalisation makes access to these archives broader and more inclusive…the abundance of archives doesn’t disappear the ways in which enslaved people are represented’ (32m30s). She also noted how if there are paywalls, the ones who gain may be those from the countries that profited from slavery. Access to digital archives does not erase the power constructed within them, so Fuentes encourages approaching them critically. Archival studies lecturer Stanley Griffin from the University of West Indies also discussed the limits of digital archives, noting that while memory is ‘resurrected’ by technology, ‘still, we cannot hear them’ (2h.04m.00s). He reminds the audience how for marginalised people, ‘a drum, a song, a movement…they are a means of creating information, of sharing information, of passing down information’ (2h.08m.40s). Digitised archives based on written outputs and records reflect the perspectives of the colonial masters who wrote them and do not fully capture cultural expressions. Griffin ends by playing a video where a slave chant is recorded and combined with visuals of the plantation, noting that this is ‘another form of digitisation’ (2h.13m.30s) that bring the focus on the people and not on the records, which was what the Rijksmuseum was striving for.

      ###### 3.3 *Look at Me Now*: Engaging the public to reflect on slavery

      It is clear that much effort and collaboration from professionals from different disciplines was necessary to stage the exhibition. But apart from experts, the museum also invited the public to engage in telling the story of slavery. After experiencing the *Slavery* exhibit (online or onsite), visitors were encouraged to participate in the creation of the Look at Me Now sculptures. LAMN consisted of ten sculptures on the Rijksmuseum premises, one for each person featured in *Slavery*. From May to August 2021, artists David Bade and Tirzo Martha from Curacao built the sculptures based on contributions from the public.

      A form of public humanities, LAMN asked citizens to reflect on the ten stories and consider: *Who made the greatest impression on you? How would you like to tell their story?* For each story, there was also a prompt that related the story of that individual to the visitor in the present day (see Figure 9 for examples). The public could submit ideas for their chosen sculpture via email or send a handmade piece to the museum. David and Tirzo worked on the sculptures everyday based on these contributions. The progress of each sculpture can be viewed on the Rijksmuseum website as well.

      ##### 4. Other efforts in re-examining the museum collection

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/766926d7f3a4df556d68e07fdf951a90a0f88d2b-71132.gif)The museum also embarked on the *Rijksmuseum and Slavery* initiative alongside the temporary exhibition *Slavery*. Works in the Rijksmuseum were initially meant to glorify the history of the Netherlands, and through this initiative, they have been re-examined to reveal previously unknown links to oppression and slavery. Additional labels were then added to paintings and objects in the museum to explain a previously hidden connection. While the labels from the Rijksmuseum and Slavery initiative were on from February 2022 to February 2023, these are available for download from the Rijksmuseum website. Moving forward, the museum endeavours to continue to evaluate their labels, noting that ‘wherever possible, the new information will be integrated into our museum in order to do greater justice to the Netherlands’ complicated history.’ (Rijksmuseum and Slavery n.d., paragraph).

      The museum has also created a guided tour to highlight the museum collection’s complex entanglements with Slavery. Those visiting in person can follow the route in the Colonial Past tour, available through the Rijksmuseum App. This takes them through 20 pieces connected to trade, exploitation and slavery during Dutch colonial history. This includes the Night Watch, arguably the most famous painting in the Netherlands.(For those wishing to view the additional labels from the Rijksmuseum and Slavery project, the Rijksmuseum app also provides a guided tour for these 77 works and the added information.) Extra layers of information from the app can enrich the in-person museum experience. Beyond the audio narration, text and pictures, the app makes use of music (e.g. the opening audio is a Surinamese song about slavery and violence) and explanatory videos with additional information.

      ##### 5. Conclusion

      *Slavery: Ten True Stories* is an example of an exhibition that was designed to be both a physical and a digital exhibition, with the digital elements an integral part of the exhibition strategy. The exhibition evinced a duty of care to the many anonymous individuals connected to items in the collection: portraits in which the enslaved are not named, items created by enslaved artisans whose names were not recorded, or only recorded by their first names, as well as the many individuals whose identities were submerged into new ones in written in ledgers and journals as they progressed from free individuals to the enslaved.

      The digital afterlife of the exhibition records and preserves these stories for a wider public audience, making it a model for curating an exhibition in multiple modalities.

      ***Footnotes:***\
      \[1] The exhibition was staged at the Rijksmuseum from 5 June to 29 August (Yang, 2022). It was planned for May 18 to August 29, 2021, but due to the pandemic, the Rijksmuseum was closed to the public from December 2020 to June 4, 2021.

      \[2] The basis for the online version was the audio tour that every visitor to the physical exhibition received. To underline the importance of oral sources, the museum chose to give all visitors a device with the audio tour for free.

      ##### Introduction

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/69f485f0184b3decdc32f235b384fc0754ac9ab1-71345.JPG)*University of the Philippines-Diliman by Ramon FVelasquez*

      In 2016, the College of Humanities of the University of the Philippines in Diliman burnt to the ground in a fire that wiped out the Pablo K. Botor Library, containing hundreds of theses and unique copies of books. This was not an isolated event: between 2013 and 2018, four buildings of the University of the Philippines and the National Historical Archives of The Philippines burnt down. It was precisely the issue of document preservation that led a group from the University of the Philippines in Diliman and a team from the University of Antwerp to collaborate together on a project, PhilPeriodicals, that had two objectives: firstly, the preservation of documents, especially newspapers because of their vulnerability and their importance for the study of artistic production, history, and Philippine society. And secondly, improving the accessibility of these documents, not only from outside the Philippines, but from within the Philippines, as even for Filipino scholars the distances, time, and money needed to travel to consult them could be prohibitive.

      The research team of the University of Antwerp belongs to the research group ACDC and includes Mike Kestemont, Dirk Van Hulle and myself among others, while the interdisciplinary team from the University of the Philippines was spearheaded initially by Sir Anril P. Tiatco and afterwards by Ramon Guillermo, joined by Anna Sarmiento and Chito Angeles, the head librarian of the University of the Philippines. Together, we applied for a TEAM project from the Flemish Agency for Academic Cooperation (VLIRUOS) and were successful in obtaining a four-year grant for €249,922 with the goal of preserving these unique documents, strengthening collaboration between our teams, as well as provide training in digital skills to professors in order to analyze and utilise these documents. Another no less important goal was to train the library team in methods to make these documents publicly available.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6ab88e2a02c585f02e8e941af820bdd666171c63-71344.jpeg)*Important figures from Philippine culture\
      featured in the newspapers, such as\
      Rosa Sevilla de Alvero, an advocate for\
      female suffrage and the founder of the first\
      Catholic school for women* *in the Philippines.*

      Departing from these goals, we were able to define three main objectives: (1) the digitization of newspapers and creation of a repository, which joined other digitization projects already undertaken in the country such as at the University of Santo Tomás Digital Library, funded by Unibank, or the Filipinas Heritage Library Online carried out by Ayala Foundation (for more information on digitizing projects in the Philippines, see Ortuño Casanova and Sarmiento 2021). The project also facilitated the purchase of equipment, and trained library staff, as well as undertook the transcription of the materials; (2) the organisation of training courses in digital humanities for academic staff to exploit the digitised materials for distant reading; and (3) the organisation of an exhibition to bring these materials to the public.

      The significance of our project lay in the importance of the documents for understanding and valuing Philippine history, especially at a time when anti-Ferdinand Marcos documents were being censored and the history of the period was being rewritten with alternative discourses. Therefore, the project not only encouraged a return to historical sources, but provided the means to undertake quantitative analysis of them. This was especially important to provide an antidote to the many historical hoaxes and fake news circulating in the media, in books and in society. Additionally, the digitised documents were important for researchers and audiences outside the Philippines: the use of first-hand materials can highlight the Eurocentric and hierarchical discourses used in colonial times and, by reflecting on them, help to avoid such biases in present-day research and societal discourse. The availability of such an archive is key to discussions of decolonisation in the Global North, as well as to counter resurrected narratives such as that going on in Spain in which the nineteenth-century idea of the benefits of colonisation, civilisation, and mestizaje is being repeated. In bringing all these documents into the public domain, we considered ways in which they could reach both, academics who could produce new knowledge from them, as well as the community, by asking such questions as:

      > What could the digitisation of Philippine documents contribute to the knowledge of Philippine history by locals and outsiders alike?
      >
      > How could it help the re-appropriation of their own history, which was sometimes written in languages that are not widely known to the public and researchers?

      One of the added values of digitisation, apart from bringing the materials in disparate locations together, was the possibility of automatic translation of the materials: the Philippines is a country with more than 130 official local languages, while much of the historical press is written in Spanish, English, and Tagalog. Although English and Tagalog are still spoken in most parts of the country today, the Spanish language died out in the Twentieth century, and therefore these newspapers, which are of great historical and literary interest, tend to be less consulted. Once digitised and transcribed, they can be translated, for at least an approximate understanding, thus returning them to importance in historical discourse as well as Filipino identity. Below are three samples of newspaper scans depicting minority groups in the Philippines, one from each historical period. Click on the dots in the embedded slider below, to see the scans from the Spanish, American and Independence periods:

      ##### Challenges

      Working on such a project in the Philippines created certain challenges. Philippine internet connection is one of the slowest in the world. This hindered our attempts in using Transkribus (an automatic transcription tool to create machine readable text). It also created problems with the repository, as high-resolution images took a long time to load for users, thus necessitating alternative ways of displaying newspaper images. Moreover, the project was set back by two other factors. The first was the COVID-19 pandemic, and the second was the imposition of European logic over the interests and needs as seen by Filipino teachers, scholars, and librarians.

      The advent of COVID-19 meant that the planned physical exhibition was not able to take place, but it was launched in digital format which can be viewed on PhilPeriodicals (You can see the slider below for an impression). It offers a journey through various themes in Philippine history (literature, wars and revolutions, women and journalism, minorities in the Philippines, and the representation of Japan) with the newspaper as the primary source of knowledge. Each of these themes has its own sub-exhibition with several sections. These sections develop narratives that weave together examples taken from Philippine newspapers and magazines in various languages and underscore the importance of incorporating into the our writing and understanding of history the varied perspectives of the population, represented here by the languages in which they wrote and read. In addition, the exhibition incorporates digitised materials from other Philippine, American, or Spanish collections, not only from the repository created through this project. In this way it is possible to add important context while making links to other similar projects. In the physical version of the exhibition, which is planned to take place at the Ayala Museum in Makati, Metro Manila, we will provide a mechanism for the public to leave comments on the objects or to search for and incorporate others. We will also have computers in the exhibition room with instructions on how to search for villages or surnames in the newspaper repository. These activities can connect the public with their families' past through newspapers.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/philperiodicals-interface-632" />

      The second setback was less outward facing. Although the project was supported by the staff of the University of the Philippines who contributed ideas to the process, the needs analysis and action plan were drawn up by researchers from Antwerp, from where the money was also managed. Thus, we found that the library staff had different ideas about the priorities for use in a digital library: they prioritised the indexing of single articles over OCR. From our point of view, indexing a selection of articles was of little use: there was not an established criteria for the selection of which articles to index individually, and the indexers were doing their work without understanding the language of some of the periodicals that they were working with. We proposed instead the possibility of a word search of texts among other implementations that we, in the coordination, had wished for but did not get. The different visions for the use of the texts might have been anticipated.

      On the one hand, there was a disciplinary breach. We intended to reach an agreement between users of the repository (e.g., the researchers) and librarians. However, I think that we as users were requesting features and giving examples that were far from the expertise of people working in the library. Coming to an agreement was compounded by the pandemic and the impossibility of traveling leading to difficulties in communication. Another factor may have been due to tensions in the ownership of the project as well as the hierarchy of perceived roles and authority that is common in many digital humanities projects (e.g., the researchers vs the alt-ac contributors). Despite the discrepancy in expectations, one of the most important contributions of the project was in the purchase of scanners and the training of librarians in using them so that they could continue to digitize bibliographic material beyond the project period. Another unexpected difference in expectations occurred as the project progressed in that the Belgian team observed that the interests of Filipino/a researchers involved in digital methodologies were more interested in the study of contemporary media and social networks than in the exploitation of historical newspapers and literary materials as we were in Antwerp. Thus we needed to adapt our teaching plans and expectations regarding the use of the repository. In the following video, more considerations of the project are presented.

      *Project PI Rocío Ortuño *Casanova* details the questions the team had to wonder about after designing the project.* *These include financial and resource considerations, ethical considerations, issues with decolonisation and more.*

      ##### Conclusion

      Despite these setbacks, the project met its goals and has produced a unique repository that is used both by academics and the public. The training courses developed have been used and reused, and much to our gratification, several Filipino professors are now teaching Digital Humanities in various universities throughout the country, and at least three of our former students are pursuing PhDs related to Digital Humanities in universities in Europe and the United States. Despite, or perhaps because of the setbacks, for the collaborating teams, the knowledge exchanged was as valuable as the repository created, making us all aware of unspoken assumptions and posiotionalities, which can become a barrier to collaboration and cooperation.

      ###### This case study is written by Jenny Bergenmar and Arild Matsson. The page is designed by Felix Bui.**![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/a1dc34cab3c40d4008b1188b39a842642799d650-71319.png)**

      ###### Introduction

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ac9501705e9494f3138272ce3da0c7746a401f02-71352.png) One of the most important tools for knowledge organization is descriptive metadata. Descriptive metadata can be added to multiple media formats in different contexts: libraries, archives, and museums for instance. It makes it possible for library users to find not just the title or author of a book, but also what the book is about. The descriptive metadata in institutions is usually some kind of controlled vocabulary – a standardized set of terms or phrases used to index content in a consistent way to make it easier for users to find and retrieve content. For libraries, a well-known vocabulary is Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), used to index literature in library catalogs in the United States, but also mapped to subject headings systems in other languages. However, controlled vocabularies, such as LCSH, that offer universalized and authorized terms, have been proven to fail to represent marginalized groups adequately.

      One such group is the LGBTQ+ community. There is a long tradition of what Cait McKinney has called “information activism” in this community (McKinney 2020), building resources that facilitated access to relevant materials long before any digital infrastructures. Part of this information activism has also been efforts to change inadequate, pathologizing, and discriminatory terms included in LCSH. In general descriptive systems such as the LCSH, there are different issues, ranging from underrepresentation to misrepresentation in descriptive terms. The situation is similar in controlled vocabularies in other languages used in libraries, but LCSH also has an impact on other national systems, since terms are often mapped from these systems to LCSH. Building on the traditions of information activism in the LGBTQ+ community, separate indexing systems for LGBTQ+ materials have been developed, such as the Homosaurus, an English-language linked data vocabulary, intended to function as a companion to broad subject term systems to make it easier for users to find LGBTQ+ related materials.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/queerlit-636" />

      In the project **Queerlit**: Metadata Development and Searchability for LGBTQI\[1] Literary Heritage, the purpose is to create a bibliography of Swedish LGBTQI literature, a Swedish language vocabulary to describe this material, and an interface to make it easier for users to find the subjects they look for. In Sweden, the metadata system used in the National Union Catalog (Libris) is called Swedish Subject Headings (SAO). In it, the terms describing LGBTQI experiences and identities are few and broad. For example, only the general term ‘transgendered people’ exists, while more specific ones such as ‘trans men’, ‘trans women’, or ‘transitioning’ are absent. The Queerlit project developed a thesaurus, QLIT, for the topical description of LGBTQI literature. A thesaurus is a list of terms, which also includes references to preferred and related terms. It is most often organized as a hierarchical structure. QLIT is used in the Queerlit bibliography. Both the Queerlit bibliography and the QLIT thesaurus are interventions into the Swedish National Union Catalog (Libris), utilizing the possibilities of linked data. Linked data makes it possible to use an external resource, such as QLIT, in the library system. This means that the Queerlit bibliography and the QLIT terms are accessible in Libris web search, as well as through the interface developed by the project.

      We have chosen to work with fiction and not non-fiction because fiction is usually indexed to a lesser extent. The subject indexing of fiction in libraries is usually limited to genre, complemented with facets of time and place. Libraries seldom have the resources to index fiction more comprehensively, since it involves meaning-making at another level than non-fiction, including metaphors, intertexts, and themes that are abstract rather than manifest. At the same time, fiction is central to the collective history of LGBTQ+ people. It reflects societal values, as well as individual experiences of sexuality and gender identity. Disenfranchised groups, like LGBTQ+ people in history, often leave a lack of historical sources behind, especially narrations told from their perspective. In that light, literature is a particularly crucial source for understanding the prejudices, oppression, and violence that has affected this group, and also for the understanding of subjective LGBTQ+ experiences.

      In this video, Jenny Bergenmar explains how the Queerlit project has worked with transformative metadata, and how the QLIT thesaurus has been developed and used in the Queerlit bibliography.

      <IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dii3Wy8itpM?si=Yyl6dAd3z2tXoEao" title="YouTube video player" />

      ###### Impact in practice

      Besides increasing the general level of indexing of literary works, the result of indexing with QLIT is that LGBTQ+ literature is made visible and searchable in different ways:

      *![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b6f6722ad4538b988fe75973a596cb134d89e29a-71353.jpeg)Precise subject terms*

      More specified terms make more precise searches possible. The novel Moscow baby by Håkan Lindgren (2017) is about a male couple who become parents with the aid of a surrogate mother. The terms “surrogatmödrar” (surrogate mothers), and “homosexuella män” (homosexual men) were available in (SAO). The QLIT terms “Skaffa barn (HBTQI)” (having children), “Bögar” (gay men), “Bisexuella män (bisexual men), and ”Surrogatskap” (Surrogacy) were added. As well as making it visible that the book is not only about homosexual men, but also about bisexual men, these terms also make it possible to search for all books about LGBTQI persons having children, or to narrow it down to homosexual men having children, or to search for LGBTQ+ books including surrogacy.

      *Major and minor motifs*

      The indexing of titles with main LGBTQ+ motifs and characters, as well as titles where LGBTQ+ motifs and characters are more peripheral means that many more titles can be made searchable. That motifs and characters are peripheral is indicated in the metadata itself so that the user can easily see if non-normative gender identities or sexualities are a main theme or only mentioned in passing. Many of the titles also have descriptive text specifying the reason for its inclusion. One example is Viktor Rydberg’s short novel Singoalla (1857). As is the case in older literature generally, there is no explicit representation of same-sex love. However, there are both symbolic elements and a platonic idealization of young male bodies. Like most literary works, Singoalla had a basic indexing in the National Union Catalog with terms for genre, “Romaner” (Novels), and “Kärleksskildringar” (Love stories). The following terms QLIT terms were added: “Antik symbolik (HBTQI) – perifert” (classical antiquity symbolism LGBTQI – peripheral), “Begär (HBTQI) – perifert” (desire LGBTQI – peripheral), and “Svärmisk vänskap – perifert” (romantic friendship – peripheral). The addition of LGBTQI in the term itself serves to avoid overlapping terms. “Begär (HBTQI)” (desire LGBTQI) indicates that this term should be distinguished from the term “Begär" (Desire) in SAO that can be used generally. The inclusion of “perifert” (peripheral) in the term serves as a transformative metadata practice, moving beyond the usual practice of only indexing major themes or characters, and in this way capturing queer characters or actions that are marginal in literary history. The basis of the inclusion of the work and the indexing with the QLIT terms is previous research that has included the author in a queer literary canon and describes the classical symbolism and the same-sex desire.

      *Symbolism*

      The creation of terms for symbolism may function as a new path into a queer literary tradition, capturing more elusive queer characters and actions, and making it possible to compare the use of metaphors over time. The term “Spegelsymbolik (HBTQI)” (mirror symbolism LGBTQI) connects texts in different genres from the early twentieth century until today.

      One benefit of open-linked vocabularies is that mapping between different systems also allows the user to trace descriptive links across different resources. QLIT is mapped to the Homosaurus, the largest LGBTQ+ linked data vocabulary, and through this mapping users interested in specific topics relevant to LGBTQ+ cultural heritage can use the same terms to search materials across institutions and media types.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/homosaurus-635" />

      *Hierarchical term search*

      As QLIT is hierarchically organized, an important feature of the search interface is the possibility to search for broad terms and retrieve works indexed with narrower terms. For example, a search for the QLIT term “HBTQI-ungdomar” (LGBTQI youth) will include the novel När jag åker hem (When I go home, 2022) because it has been indexed with the QLIT term "Unga lesbiska" (Young lesbians).

      ###### Developing the search interface

      In the project, two surveys were carried out, one directed towards general readers and one towards librarians. They both showed that the web search functionalities of Swedish library catalogs, including Libris, were unsatisfactory. While the Libris user interface is out of our control, the underlying database is open for public use through an Application Programming Interface (API). The database has great searching capabilities, and its API exposes them to external applications.

      The Queerlit interface is built as a web browser application that connects to the Libris database. It translates user input to a query for the API, and then displays the results. This way, Queerlit can leverage the database already developed by Libris, who, on their end, has been an active partner in the project. In several cases, they have been able to develop features for the API to support new use cases.

      Our envisioned users span a spectrum from laypeople to researchers. The user interface needs to be unintimidating and inviting to new users. Many of them will not be familiar with all the concepts that are present, such as subject headings, genre keywords, and histograms. We still want them to quickly find and understand how they can use the interface for their benefit. This is true for any user interface, but some expert applications can expect most users to arrive with a clear goal in mind and a willingness to spend some time learning. In consideration of these users, features that require a little more engagement should also be close to hand.

      <IframeElement w={400} h={225} alt="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3qy-wfsFTM?si=ouSCRblGyUmSwV-o" title="YouTube video player" />

      *Video: Queerlit Search Interface* As highlighted in the video linked on the right, the interface uses the subject headings of the QLIT thesaurus as one of the primary means for navigation and searching. While this has proved to be helpful for many users, it is reasonable only in conjunction with our efforts to use the thesaurus extensively when indexing. QLIT terms are visually marked with a yellow "label" style throughout the website. We have recently started performing user testing. These are short sessions where we sit down together with potential users and ask them to perform some common tasks using the application, such as "Find coming out stories about gay men" or "Are there any books by Astrid Lindgren?". We take notes of their usage and their reactions to the interface and then use these as guidance for further development. If we are going to spend days perfecting some nifty autocomplete functionality, we will want to know whether our users understand how to use it.

      Since Queerlit is a part of Libris, it has the benefit of being integrated into a large, national library infrastructure, and the literature in Queerlit is visible among all other literature that is searchable in Libris web search. The benefit of the interface developed by the project, on the other hand, is that it builds on specific user needs and domain-specific expertise and that it makes use of the terms in the QLIT thesaurus to help users more easily access literature on specific topics. In this way, the interface is one way of "working that validate\[s] local experiences of data without removing from a more global network of information exchange" (Rawson & Munoz 2019).

      ##### Introduction

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7800e2185cc84a180d53e4eb861939610a7f5c4a-71364.jpeg)The histories and legacies of Atlantic slavery have been receiving increasing global attention. This “slavery memory” boom has been traced back to the latter half of the twentieth century (Araújo, 2012) and has gathered particular momentum in the last decade. With the rise of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, questions over culpability, reparations, and how to remember have been playing out in “statue wars”, memorials, and public debates across the United States and United Kingdom. Nations including the Netherlands, France, and Colombia have for the first time been examining their own roles and ongoing debts in this history through public exhibitions (Rijksmuseum’s Slavery, 2021; Musée d’histoire de Nantes’ The Abyss: Nantes’s Role in the Slave Trade and Colonial Slavery 1707-1830, 2021; Museo del Oro’s On board a slave ship, La Marie-Séraphique, 2018-2019).

      In Australia, ties to Atlantic slavery have been uncovered through the nation’s colonial roots. British slaveowners brought wealth, ideas and practices regarding race and labour to Australia, in turn developing several major industries based predominantly on the unfree labour of First Nations people as well as migrants. First Nations people have been experiencing and speaking of racism, dispossession, and historical injustice since colonisation, and Aboriginal people and Australian South Sea Islanders have explicitly referred to their exploitation as slavery (Bandler 2003; Watson 2012, p. 67; Davis 2017). However, the issue of slavery in Australia has only received more widespread attention recently. BLM debates sparked re-examinations of “blackbirding” in the northwest pearling industry and Queensland’s sugar cane fields, while legal claims for stolen wages have brought under public scrutiny the unpaid labour of Aboriginal pastoral workers across the country (Buchanan 2020; Anthony and Gray 2020; Morse 2023).

      The Western Australian Legacies of British Slavery (WALBS) project has been uncovering Australia’s colonial ties to Atlantic slavery by tracing the movement of people, wealth and culture from slave-owning Britain to Australia in the nineteenth century. Research has been primarily biographical, identifying hundreds of individuals including British slaveowners, beneficiaries of slavery, and more recently, enslaved people. In conjunction with this research, our project team has been working with software developers at the University of Newcastle who have created the Time-Layered Cultural Map (TLCMap), to plot out the spatio-temporal movements of a selection of these individuals, and to allow for journey-mapping using digital means and data. TLCMap is not a singular map per se, but rather a range of software tools - or “software ecosystem” - that allows humanities and social science researchers to create, share, visualise, and analyse digital maps. Using TLCMap’s Gazetteer of Historical Australian Places, the journeys of six individuals were plotted out on a 3D map. Each journey is visualised by a series of geographical points that users can click on to view information including the dates the individual was there, a brief biographical summary of what occurred whilst there or the significance of this place, and links to relevant images. There are multiple visualisations, including one mode featuring a moveable timeline, and another that links each point of an individual’s journey.

      ##### Partial data

      The WALBS research began by uncovering slaveowners and colonists who benefited from slavery, as it followed the records of payments made to British slaveowners as ‘compensation’ for the loss of their 'property’ – human beings – following abolition. Attention has more recently shifted to tracing the lives of the enslaved. This has raised challenges around the bias of data, as primary (and often secondary) source materials drawn upon are weighted virtually wholly in favour of colonial authorities. Details of colonists and slaveowners document and glorify their own acts, while entire lives of the enslaved are written out of records. Saidiya Hartman (2008) describes how the only glimpses we have of the enslaved are via their brief, distorted, and violent encounters with power. (Projects such as the SlaveVoyages database, which includes data on some 92,000 Africans forced to make the voyage from Africa to and within the Americas, offer notable and large-scale counters to the silences.) Looking at the colonial history of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, Malcolm Allbrook (2023) refers to the “hidden population” of Aboriginal men and women who were kidnapped and forced into the brutal work of pearl diving, which many have described as slavery. At best, we know the names and homelands of these people – at worst, a misrecorded “native” name or derogatory “alias” name assigned by the British, and inaccurate or unrecorded lands of origin. Many may not have been recorded at all.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/57a88410b6d57673953bc9c9e5e9e3d1300fabf6-71358.jpg)*Figure 2: This 1882 register of Aboriginal pearl divers in the northwest of Australia shows the very limited and likely inaccurate information recorded about these individuals. “Native” and “alias” names both represent Anglicisations of true names.*\
      Dealing with missing or “fuzzy” data can be particularly challenging when working with formats demanding precise information. TLCMap requires detailed geographical and temporal data: longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, and dates down to an exact day. When selecting individuals to map the journeys of, this can potentially exclude the enslaved due to too much missing information. In the case of Aboriginal pearl divers, the only traceable locations may be their land of origin and location of work. In the case of slaveowners and colonists, however, detailed biographical data is often available. For instance, we are researching the life of James Stirling, a British colonist with connections to slavery through his naval experience and his family’s commerce, for which there is a dense and thorough biography listing decades’ worth of dates and locations (Staham-Drew 2003). Maps preference colonial data. Many have spoken about the Eurocentrism and colonial bias of cartography. Thomas J. McGurk and Sébastien Caquard describe mapmaking as a “tool of dispossession” that frames and delineates land in economic terms (2020, 52). Map-makers construct templates and variables based on assumptions about what data is of value, and the data drawn upon is constructed according to the biases of those who record and create it. We are developing certain strategies in response to this.

      ##### Mapping silence and responding to bias

      To accommodate the gaps in our data, we have moderated our templates, including “notes” fields that allow us to comment on the way a particular date or location has been obtained. Discussion includes how estimates have been devised, as well as the limitations of the records available. This allows critical reflections on the biases of the archives, and less rigidity in the requirements for data. For instance, mapping the life of William Hickman - a man from Jamaica who was enslaved but later “emancipated” and taken to Western Australia as an “indentured” servant for a British colonist - we are unaware of the date that he arrived in Australia. He is first mentioned when described on 15 January 1830 as a servant to a colonial “master” in the “Swan River Colony” - the river known to Noongar people as Derbarl Yerrigan - in the area of Boorloo / Perth. In the “Date notes” field we are able to discuss the fact that Hickman’s name is not listed on a ship’s register of names, and that often the little we hear of the enslaved are their encounters with colonial authorities. We have also incorporated other materials, beyond geographical and temporal data, that can be visualised and narrated to tell the story of a person’s life. In particular we have placed emphasis on biographical text, first-person quotations, and images, to add more richness and colour to the narrative despite limited archival records.

      *Figure 3: Click on the hotspots above to explore the different features of the TLC Maps.*\
      The use of language and place names also offers ways of navigating bias. Maria Therese Stephansen (2017) describes how Sami activist and artist Hans Ragnar Mathisen’s map of Sápmi creates a counter-narrative to official histories from Norway, Finland and Sweden by presenting the region through the Sami people’s cultural and geographical terms, featuring 920 Sami place names. TLCMap system architect Bill Pascoe (2022), reflecting on the “Massacre Map”, which locates frontier massacres in colonial Australia, refers to questions around the naming of particular sites and massacres that have both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal names. He also discusses the significance of choices around words such as “perpetrators”, “murderers”, “killers”, and so on. For our project we are using First Nations place names in the first instance, with British colonial names listed second. Narrative biographical text describes individuals of interest as “colonists” and “slaveowners” rather than “settlers”, and places terms of ownership in quotations such as “purchased” and “owned”.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/951b74eefffedc85dee14dc6d63dedd18c58fe94-71356.png)*Figure 4: The Black Pearl, by Badimia-Yamatji artist Julie Dowling, 2002. Dowling explains, “This painting is about the slavery of First Nation men and women in the early pearl industry in Cossack, Derby and Broome in the north-west of Western Australia”. Including links to images such as these allows us to instil more depth to the lives of those whose stories are barely recorded in colonial archives.*\
      TLCMap offers a centralised and accessible space for humanities researchers as well as members of the public to share, build, analyse, and visualise data. We are now exploring the incorporation of TLCMap into a public exhibition on the legacies of slavery in Australia hosted by the Australian National Maritime Museum. This will offer an interactive and digital layer of interpretation, facilitating more ways of learning for wider audiences.

      3.7 Shanghai Cultural Collections: The interplay between genre, stories and memory
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/a1dc34cab3c40d4008b1188b39a842642799d650-71319.png)##### This case study is written by Yaming Fu. This case study is designed by Emma Prebreza and Claudio Lo Sciuto.

      ##### Introduction

      The Shanghai Cultural Collections Database (上海文化总库) is a digital humanities platform designed and maintained by Shanghai Library. It integrates a wide range of resources and knowledge databases related to Shanghai city in modern times (1825-1949, from the opening of the Treaty Port at the end of the Qing Dynasty to the founding of the People's Republic of China and beyond), presenting resources that reflect the events, people, life, buildings, and social status as shown in the press and other publications, literature, film, drama, music, art and other categories.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/9fe6a143b5bde0adb6860b28c12c68aaa72272f5-71367.png)*Figure 1: The homepage of Shanghai Cultural Collections*\
      These diverse types of resources are linked together on the platform and include books and other collections, old photos, motion pictures, musical records, maps, and audio-visual resources which record Shanghai's historical image and sound; they reflect Shanghai's cultural characteristics and tell the stories and share the knowledge behind the culture. The platform aims to connect the library collections with Shanghai historical and cultural chronology to build a digital Shanghai memory.

      ##### Rationale for the project

      Since 2014, Shanghai Library has constructed digital humanities projects using Semantic Web technologies. The descriptive information of the collections themselves, the related data and the relationships between them are encoded in a standard format via knowledge organization methods and linked data. Knowledge organization methods and linked open data are applied to extract the relevant elements and related details about people, location, time, events, and activities from the appropriate library collection resources with the specific requirements from the users. The knowledge organization method, which combines Bibliographic Control and Authority Control of the library with the technical Ontology, provides the implementation scheme.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/50c1418c9918e59a25c3f7fd8998ec1d3c3336d8-71368.png)*Figure 2: The rationale behind DH projects constructed at Shanghai Library*![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5e6a86372ac0845040f673e0a63d5a0252d14d8f-71369.png)*Figure 3: The rationale behind Shanghai Cultural Collections platform*\
      Traditional historical narratives often focus on dominant perspectives, sidelining or erasing the experiences of marginalized communities. Incorporating diverse resources like archival materials, personal accounts and old photos into a digital platform, can help bring forth the stories of those who have been historically marginalized, promoting a more inclusive and just representation of the city's history. Through making these various types of historical resources accessible via a digital platform, this project serves as an educational tool for raising awareness about the complexities of a city’s history and their lasting impact on social justice issues.

      More importantly, as this is the public library in Shanghai, the project and its future development involves collaboration with local communities, giving them a platform to share their personal stories and contribute to the representation of their histories. In our project, ‘\[…] digital methods help us to access and share marginalized or silenced voices and to incorporate them into our work in ways not possible in print or the space of an exhibition gallery.’ (Brennan, 2019). The official records held in the archives and libraries have to an extent been mediated and represent the official record, regardless of the sources, with all the inherent and unescapable biases. In Shanghai these have been particularly influenced by the long-term colonial occupation and the shorter but to an extent more divisive ravages of the Japanese occupation. The prevailing historical record has been unavoidably shaped by these events and factors external to Shanghai and China. As Jennifer Guilliano argues, ‘the embrace of capitalism, and the consequences of colonialism have long affected and been central in the discipline of history’ (Guilliano, 2022. p.5.). This project fills the gaps in the historical and cultural record so that we can ‘ensure that the stories and voices which have been underrepresented in both print and digital knowledge production \[…] can be heard (Risam, 2018. p.129). This participation will empower these communities and provide them with a means for their voices to be heard and acknowledged.

      In this project, we also follow cultural memory theory from Assmann and Czaplicka where cultural memory connects together the three aspects of ‘memory (the contemporized past), culture, and the group (society)’, emphasizing the different ways in which communities form their cultural understanding over the course of their history (Assmann and Czaplicka, 1995. p.129).

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/9c650bd5ca6563669d5f78ac493d43f3024cc661-71375.png)*Figure 4: Quote from Assmann, 2008* To interpret the inert knowledge hidden in the memory archives, it can be inspected and reclaimed by situating it in a new memory context (Assmann, 2008). Moreover, the feelings experienced in places that carry the passage of time and historical events are more vivid than those experienced by reading. The physicality of place combined with personal history and experience can trigger powerful emotions. Moving through a space ‘at a particular time, in a particular way \[…] might deepen our understanding of human interaction with \[that] place more broadly. It means communicating these things meaningfully as stories or arguments’ (Dunn, 2019. p.156)

      ##### Why digital humanities

      In this project, a digital humanities paradigm and relevant methods are adopted to integrate, link, curate and help to explore various types of historical resources preserved in our library and beyond. Digital methods allow for the preservation of memories and the continued accessibility of the information held in our diverse historical resources. By digitizing archives, old photos, maps, and other materials, these resources become widely available, overcoming physical limitations and ensuring that the information they hold is not lost to time or deterioration. Moreover, the digital platform makes it possible for researchers from various locations and backgrounds to access the information without the need to physically visit the library. This reduces barriers related to geography, financial resources, and physical abilities, promoting equal opportunities for researchers regardless of their location or circumstances.

      ##### Functions:

      1\) This platform serves as a one-stop disclosure of the diverse cultural resources in Shanghai, and provides the exploration on the correlation and interoperability of multiple types of resources through standardized entities such as personal names, organization, and place names.

      2\) According to the characteristics of the resources, they reveal various information visually in the form of timelines, maps, films, etc.

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/shl-maps-sample-figure-5-681" />

      3\) Linked data techniques enable the connection of various types of information. This interconnectedness allows for a more holistic view of the history, connecting different narratives, events, and perspectives. It helps in revealing patterns, relationships, and dependencies that might not be immediately apparent in the traditional, isolated historical records.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/837663fb7fe20b4264fa69deff3436e74bd00c3c-71371.png)*Figure 6: The interface for exploring old photos, as well as photos related to it*![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/1f37aa2c1ab273c885b71f864018471b2f161cb8-71372.png)

      *Figure 7: This is a mapping of the relationships of a chosen individual, made possible through linked data*\
      4\) Spatial and temporal visualizations, such as Historical Geographic Information Systems (HGIS), provide intuitive ways to present complex historical data. They allow users to see patterns, changes over time, and spatial relationships, making historical narratives more engaging and understandable for a broader audience.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/21769404650327c5edec9ae69ec2a33bb460ceda-71373.png)*Figure 8: You can explore information about the movie theatre in many ways*![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8ed3d4bde412fdf9e60ac432f9fbc21a9ae89dc9-71374.png)*Figure 9: Related events are visualised in a timeline view*\
      5\) Users can engage with the platform, explore different resources, and, where possible and appropriate, even contribute their own materials or stories. This interactivity fosters a sense of participation, empowering communities and encouraging dialogue around historical narratives and social justice issues.

      By leveraging these digital humanities methods, the Shanghai Cultural Collections project creates a comprehensive and inclusive digital platform that not only archives historical information but also actively contributes to raising awareness, promoting dialogue, and fostering a more just understanding of the city's history and its implications for social justice. The project provides a platform for the voices which are usually excluded from the official record – the marginalized and otherwise less represented citizens.

The second tool is the **Consent Form Wizard**, which helps researchers create GDPR-compliant consent forms (which is most important for those working within the European Union). It simplifies the process and ensures that all necessary information is included, making it easier to obtain informed consent from individuals. Both tools are valuable resources for researchers looking to navigate the legal but also ethical considerations regarding the data of their projects.

      The Public License Selector is a tool developed by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague. It is designed to help researchers, developers, and other interested parties easily select the most appropriate license for their work. The tool is designed for open-source software and data subject to copyright and other regulations. It is aimed to help users quickly and easily select the most appropriate license for their work, ensuring that the rights of authors and users of the software and/or data are properly protected. The tool is also useful for ensuring compliance with copyright laws and other regulations. The web-based interface allows users to either search for a specific license or to find a suitable license for their data/software based on a questionnaire. The user can then review the suggested license and make any necessary changes before finalizing their selection. The tool can be implemented in repositories on request and is already used in the CLARIN DSpace repositories and the EUDAT B2SHARE repository.

      ###### **Why use the tool?**

      Open licensing of software and data is often neglected, especially in the academic context. In addition, licenses for data and software have different focuses, which further complicates the choice of an appropriate license. Data licensing deals with the protection of intellectual property and is subject to copyright laws and other regulations, while software licensing deals with the protection of functional products and is not subject to the same level of regulation.

      Software licenses tend to focus on issues such as the right to use, modify, and redistribute the software. Data licenses are generally more restrictive and complex than software licenses because they must address issues such as the right to copy, adapt, modify, and distribute the data. Moreover, data licenses often include provisions to protect the data itself, such as restricting access to the data or prohibiting its use for commercial purposes.

      The Public License Selector is a useful tool that provides users with an easy way to compare and select the appropriate license for their data or software. It allows users to quickly identify the license that best suits their needs and provides detailed information about the different licenses available, such as the rights and restrictions associated with each license. This can help users avoid potential legal issues by choosing the right license for their data or software. The Public License Selector is also useful for educational purposes.

      By providing a simple way for users to choose the most appropriate license for their work, the tool can help raise awareness of copyright and promote the use of open-source software.

      ###### **Consent Form Wizard**

      The ELDAH **Consent Form Wizard** is an online tool developed by the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH) and the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-EU) to help researchers working in the European Union create GDPR-compliant consent forms for their research projects, events (such as conferences) or mailing lists. It provides a simple, step-by-step process for creating a consent form tailored to the specific needs of each project and ensures that all the necessary information is included. The tool allows users to choose from several pre-set options, including the type of data to be collected, the purpose of the research, and the duration of the project. It also allows users to add custom information specific to their use case. Once completed, the form can be downloaded as a raw text file and further processed either in a word processor or embedded in a web page. The tool is also available in several languages, making it accessible to a wider range of users.

      ![Consent Form Wizard Logo ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5e10cf8f4e28e39014b41b36372b5e62a5d627d5-71406.svg)#####  **Why using the tool?**

      In general, there are certain exemptions from the data protection requirements for research in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, there are still certain conditions that must be met for research to be exempt from the GDPR. First, the research must be 'necessary for scientific or historical research purposes' and must be conducted in the public interest. Second, the research must be carried out in accordance with "appropriate safeguards" to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals. This includes ensuring that data is kept secure and that individuals are informed of their rights under the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR also states that any research involving sensitive data, such as health information, must still be subject to the same data protection requirements. This includes obtaining explicit consent from individuals for the collection and processing of their sensitive personal data.

      **It should also be noted that although researchers are not required to obtain explicit consent from individuals for the collection, processing, and use of personal data for research purposes that is not sensitive data, it has become a general ethical consensus in scientific practice to obtain informed consent in these cases as well.**

      4.2 Data Ethics
    </LessonPageTitle>

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/462833e7d64acd92255180b8b6ff3b85d7d7af37-71415.png)This page of the Tools and Tutorials section of the Toolkit introduces three tools related to data ethics. The first tool is the **Data Ethics Toolkit**, which helps citizen and community science practitioners explore ethical considerations around data. It guides project leaders in identifying ethical issues and incorporating ethical principles into their projects. The second tool is the **Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit**, which helps organizations develop ethical algorithms and assess potential risks and biases. It provides tools and resources throughout the algorithm development lifecycle. The third tool is the **FAIR Data Maturity Model**, which helps to assess how FAIR the research data is by providing indicators and levels of FAIRness. It helps researchers, data publishers, and funding agencies to improve the accessibility and usability of their data. These tools aim to promote the responsible and trustworthy use of data in research projects.

      ###### **Data Ethics Toolkit**

      ![Data Ethics Toolkit by Citizen Science Association](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/50c9c382b0810f13cef13f9f1ba8b75d4cb2b0b7-71434.png)

      The Data Ethics in the Participatory Sciences Toolkit is a resource created by and for citizen and community science practitioners to explore and identify ethical considerations around data. It has been designed to support the Citizen Science Association's capacity to promote a culture of data ethics in the participatory sciences. The toolkit focuses primarily on project leaders of top-down, institutionally driven projects and considers the obligations between project leaders, participants, and partners. It is designed to support ethical thinking, but with the understanding that a culture of ethical norms is necessary to promote ethical behavior. It guides project leaders to identify ethical issues and obligations and to learn how to use key ethical concepts and principles to make appropriate decisions for their projects. It should be noted that the toolkit is mostly US-focused, so you have to take into consideration that your projects may be subject to laws, regulations, and policies that are not covered in the toolkit.

      ###### **Why use this tool?**

      In general, data ethics is important because it helps ensure data is used responsibly and trustworthy. This includes considering the ethical implications of the collection, storage, and sharing of data and the potential impact of the data on the people who generate or are affected by the data. Data ethics helps to ensure that people's privacy and rights are respected when data is used, and that data is collected and used ethically and responsibly. It also assists in building trust between data users and the people whose data is used, and in ensuring that data is used for the benefit of everyone. The Data Ethics Toolkit is designed to assist you in recognizing and evaluating ethical considerations related to data generated especially by participatory science projects.

      Using this toolkit, you will be able to make appropriate decisions for your project by incorporating ethical principles such as respect, reciprocity, transparency, and accountability. It emphasizes two main obligations: to the participants who make the research possible, and to the science itself. This toolkit aims to facilitate data governance that broadens decision-making and meets the needs of both participants and science.

      ###### **Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit**

      The Ethics & Algorithm Toolkit, developed by the Center of Government Excellence (GovEx) at Johns Hopkins University, DataSF, the Civic Analytics Network at Harvard University, and Data Community DC, is an online platform to help organizations develop ethical algorithms. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, guidelines, resources, and templates to help organizations design, develop, and deploy ethical algorithms. It also entails a risk assessment framework to evaluate the potential for an algorithm to cause harm. The toolkit covers the entire lifecycle of ethical algorithm development and deployment, from initial design to actual implementation. GovEx has worked with leading organizations and experts in the field to ensure that the toolkit is comprehensive and up-to-date with best practices. The toolkit is designed to provide guidance and support to organizations seeking to develop ethical algorithms and help reduce the potential for harm.

      ![Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b23d54af6659789feda7f751ca2c80e867cf45a3-71438.jpg)#####  **Why use this tool?**

      Algorithms and AI applications can have biases that lead to injustice and harm. For example, facial recognition algorithms have been found to be less accurate at identifying people from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds, leading to false positives. In addition, algorithms used to predict criminal recidivism are biased against certain racial and ethnic groups. Algorithms used to assess job applicants have also been found to discriminate against women. Thus, to minimize the risks associated with algorithms and AI applications, it is important to ensure that ethical considerations are taken into account in their development and use. This includes conducting a thorough risk assessment, ensuring that data is collected and used responsibly, and regularly testing and monitoring algorithms to ensure that they do not exhibit discriminatory or biased behavior. In addition, organizations should ensure that any decisions made by algorithms and AI applications are accountable and transparent, and that individuals' rights and privacy are respected.

      It should also be noted that although researchers are not required to obtain explicit consent from individuals for the collection, processing, and use of personal data for research purposes that is not sensitive data, it has become a general ethical consensus in scientific practice to obtain informed consent in these cases as well. Although initially developed to support local government, the Ethics and Algorithm Toolkit can be adapted for use in the private sector and academia and is, therefore, a useful tool for assessing and minimizing risk when developing and using an algorithm or AI application in your research. On top of that, the Ethics and Algorithms Toolkit is open source and accessible for everyone.

      ###### **FAIR Data Maturity Model**

      ![Fair Data Maturity Model](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/102f3b4f21aab4c984c5b4308ac5f39f5b77da41-71439.png)

      The RDA **FAIR Data Maturity Model** is a set of guidelines developed by the Research Data Alliance Foundation (RDA) to assess the FAIRness of research data by providing indicators, priorities, and maturity levels to measure how FAIR your data resources are. This model can be used by researchers, data publishers, project managers, and funding agencies to determine the level of FAIRness achieved by data resources and to identify where improvements can be made. Application of the model will lead to increased coherence and interoperability of existing or emerging FAIR assessment frameworks and will allow results to be compared in a meaningful way. In addition to the FAIR principles, which are provided in more detail in the "Principles and Guidelines" section of this toolkit, the FAIR Data Maturity Model provides an interactive spreadsheet that you can use to assess the FAIRness of your data easily.

      ###### **Why use this tool?**

      Keeping your data FAIR is very important because it allows data to be used more efficiently and effectively. FAIR data is more accurate, accessible, and reliable, which helps to ensure that data is used in the best possible way. With FAIR data, researchers, organizations, and businesses can make better decisions, gain insights, and create new products and services. FAIR data also helps to foster data sharing and collaboration, which are essential to drive research and innovation.

      The tool is based on the four core principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and assigns a level to each principle, ranging from 0 (not applicable) to 4 (fully implemented). To measure progress, each indicator is scored against five levels of compliance (0-4). Alternatively, the pass-or-fail approach measures FAIRness per area, taking into account the priorities, and gives a binary response for each of the indicators, with the level per area determined based on compliance with the priorities. Both approaches can be combined to take advantage of both.

      After assigning the appropriate levels to each indicator in the second sheet of the spreadsheet, you will get a detailed graphical report of the FAIRness of your data in the first sheet. This will help you to see if your data is already FAIR or if you need to work on the FAIRness of your data - if possible.

    <LessonPageContent>
      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/462833e7d64acd92255180b8b6ff3b85d7d7af37-71415.png)This section of the Toolkit presents three tools related to the topics of identity and accessibility. The first tool is the **Hemingway Editor**, which helps writers improve the clarity and readability of their writing. The second tool is the **RaceWorks Toolkit**, which provides resources and frameworks for having informed conversations about race, racism, and critical race studies. It offers videos, activities, and discussion questions to enhance understanding and navigate discussions about race and racism. The last tool is the **Mukurtu CMS** - a content management system for Indigenous communities to manage and share their digital cultural heritage. All tools aim to promote clearer communication, recognition, and inclusivity in their respective areas of focus.##### **The Hemingway Editor**

      ![Hemingway Editor ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/47e3342792a4688a97d4eb69b06e0c93665d660f-71444.png)

      Launched in 2013 by Adam and Ben Long, the Hemingway Editor is an online platform that makes writing bold and clear. It highlights parts of writing that are too dense, allowing readers to focus on the message itself rather than the prose. It also includes the Automated Readability Index to assess the level of writing. The aim is to achieve an average American reading level of tenth grade, but this is not necessarily the target audience. The editor highlights sentences that are difficult to read in yellow and those that are most difficult in red.

      ###### **Why use this tool?**

      When writing, and especially when writing academic texts, writers often forget that not all of their readers may be able to read (sometimes needlessly) complex and intricately structured texts. In this case, the Hemingway Editor can help you write more clearly and concisely. It highlights complex words and offers simpler alternatives. This can make your writing easier to read and more accessible to a wider audience. However, the editor is primarily designed for English texts, especially concerning synonyms for simplification.

      The Hemingway Editor is available as a free web application and a paid standalone desktop version (\~$20) for MacOS and Windows.

      ###### **RaceWorks Toolkit**

      RaceWorks is a free online resource created by the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) at Stanford University and Stanford SPARQ, in collaboration with various scholars and experts. It includes a series of videos, pedagogical activities, discussion questions, and evidence-based frameworks to make critical race studies more accessible to a range of learners and contexts. The toolkit is designed to prepare individuals to have more effective conversations about race, enabling them to better navigate their own communities and the larger world around them. It is free and open to the public.

      ![Raceworks Toolkit Logo ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/a38a1e1c16f5170a72115158b92deff0b6515f7f-71450.png)#####  **Why use this tool?**

      The toolkit is designed to equip students, professionals, and community advocates with the knowledge and skills necessary to have informed conversations about race and how race and racism impact our world today by providing an evidence-based framework to make critical race studies more accessible. Raceworks offers a 7-step program of informative short videos and teaching materials that can be incorporated into courses and self-study.

      The multimedia toolkit provides a research-based model for conversations about race in America today, but because it is designed to apply to a wide range of contexts, it can be used in teaching scenarios around the world (e.g. in academic curricula or professional development opportunities such as diversity, equity and inclusion training).

      ###### **The Mukurtu CMS**

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0ab5cdd48fa4bab4b06318b55753bfa03c5654fb-71445.png)

      Mukurtu (Mook-oo-too) CMS is a content management system designed specifically for Indigenous communities to manage and share their digital cultural heritage. The development of Mukurtu CMS was a collaborative effort between Indigenous communities and a team of researchers, scholars, and technologists and is maintained and further developed by the Mukurtu Team at the Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation at Washington State University.

      ###### **Why use this tool?**

      The platform aims to address the unique cultural protocols, values, and ownership rights associated with Indigenous knowledge and cultural materials and allows Indigenous communities to curate and control access to their digital collections, ensuring that cultural materials are shared in a way that aligns with their cultural practices and values. The system incorporates traditional protocols related to ownership, access, and use of cultural materials, providing a culturally sensitive and respectful approach to managing digital heritage.

      The Mukurtu CMS is an open-source platform and is therefore freely available for everyone.

The first part called **Inclusive Terminology in Technology** includes two different resources, both of which aim to deconstruct the harmful stereotypes perpetuated in the terminology and foster equality and diversity in the field of technology. The second part presents two useful **decolonizing research practices** that researchers can adopt: the 5 key points for decolonizing research methodologies, which the STEPS center incorporated in their research, and the 7-Questions-Model by Mary Shell-Weiss.##### **Inclusive Terminology in Technology**

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6731d5f5b16478960a346a54ded2a000af33d77c-71453.png)

      **Inclusive Naming Initiative**

      The Inclusive Naming Initiative, launched by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2021, aims to incorporate inclusive language across the industry. It was prompted by the increased awareness of diversity issues following the *Black Lives Matter* movement, which also impacted the open-source community. The Initiative's

      > mission is to promote and facilitate replacing harmful and exclusionary language in information technology.

      Furthermore, the Initiative is working with standards development organizations (e.g. the IEEE) by providing them resources to standardize inclusive terminology in technology worldwide. So far, it has produced useful resources such as word replacement lists, an implementation pathway, and a language framework.

      **Toward anti-racist technical Terminology**

      "Toward anti-racist technical Terminology", published by The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) and produced by a working group led by CDH lead developer Rebecca Sutton Koeser is a guide to help people in the field of digital humanities to use more inclusive language. The guide is intended to help people understand how language can be used to perpetuate racism and how it can be used to combat it. It provides a set of guidelines for using more inclusive language as well as alternatives for problematic terms in technical writing as well as other forms of communication.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/94abf4ebc5401ffec39b88c62f7bd92fdb6c490d-71454.jpg)

      ###### **Why use inclusive terminology?**

      Language shapes our worldview and can create and reinforce expectations, stereotypes, and even prejudice, so it is important to take extra care in choosing words and phrases when writing. Metaphors rooted in oppression, ableism, and colonialism are also prevalent in language, particularly in technical communities. Exclusive language can hurt and alienate people, making them feel rejected and not part of a group or team. Terms like "master/slave" are quite obvious in the damage they do by normalizing slavery. Other terms like "blacklist" and "whitelist" may seem less loaded at face value, but they perpetuate the idea that "white" is good and "black" is bad. More often than not, these "metaphors" are not only exclusionary but also unclear in their meaning.

      Inclusive terminology, on the other hand, not only promotes equality and diversity in society and the workplace but is often clearer and more precise in its explanatory effect. This should not only be applied to general academic writing but also to coding - as the two examples below confirm.

      ###### **Decolonizing Research Practices**

      **STEPS Centre**

      The STEPS Centre (Social, Technological, and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) was an interdisciplinary research and policy center hosted by the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) and the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex. The website is still active today. Its mission was to address global challenges related to science, technology, and innovation to promote sustainable development. The center focused on the politics of sustainability transformation, emphasizing the importance of inclusive and democratic processes. From 2018-2021, they actively worked on 4 themes: Transformations, Uncertainty, Nature and Methods. The last theme addresses the question of how to decolonize research.

      In their blogpost *'How Do We 'Decolonize' Research Methodologies?'*, they identify 5 entry key points to decolonize their research methods.

      ![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/f8afa4e3928f48d3bbb8f99f6efc772b06fbd186-71455.png)

      <H5PWrapper path="social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7-question-model-637" />

      **The 7-Question Model by Melanie Shell-Weiss**

      In the chapter “The Power of Narrative: A Practical Guide to Creating Decolonial, Community-Based Projects”, Melanie Shell-Weiss introduces The 7-Question Model for narrative-based projects that apply feminist and decolonial practices. The model emphasizes the process and purpose of the project, encouraging careful reflection on the intentions, positionality, and roles of all participants. The questions also consider the larger relationships and obligations between participants, both in the present and future. This approach recognizes the importance of collaboration and fosters a deeper understanding of ethics rooted in intercultural dialogue rather than existing boundaries. By engaging in dialog with community partners and collaborators, the researcher/practitioner can navigate the complexities of sharing recorded stories, interviews, and oral histories in a way that respects the involved individuals and their communities. The details and explanation of each question can be found in the full text of the chapter.

      ###### **Why does decolonizing research matter?**

      Decolonizing research involves challenging the North's dominant position in knowledge production. In the realm of research, this entails employing approaches that capture the local context and give priority to the needs, experiences, and beliefs of the research participants. The goal of decolonized research is to challenge the cognitive injustice in knowledge production by valuing local culture and knowledge. It aims to amplify indigenous voices and narratives and promote culturally sensitive knowledge production that originates from the community itself rather than being about the community. Furthermore, northern-oriented research practices tend to overlook the unique experiences and perspectives of people in the global South, leaving a considerable part of human history and narratives disregarded.
