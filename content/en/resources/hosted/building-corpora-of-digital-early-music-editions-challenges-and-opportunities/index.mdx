    The need to create a large corpus of early music data, one that coherently
    encodes and curates data that can be used for computer analysis, was the
    impetus behind the CORSICA project.  This webinar outlines the results from
    that project and how it can facilitate large data analysis of digital early
    music corpora.

This webinar shows results from the project CORSICA (Creation of Early Music Corpora). This initiative, growing from the COST action EarlyMuse, is directed by Frans Wiering (Universiteit Utrecht), with the participation of researchers from Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Austria, and Sweden. The project sprang from the need to create a large corpus of early music data, coherently encoded and curated data that could be used for computer analysis, facilitating big-data studies. Hence, the research aims to improve the number of available corpora of Renaissance music by devising protocols to create collections of digital editions and, equally important, to facilitate the reuse of a sizeable number of editions produced by a myriad of "citizen scientists" without much systematisation.
