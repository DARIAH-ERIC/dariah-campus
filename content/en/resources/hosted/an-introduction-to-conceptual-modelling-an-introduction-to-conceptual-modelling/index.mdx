    This workshop introduces the basics of conceptual modelling and ontologies.
    We discuss the principles and techniques that can be used in order to
    formulate the knowledge we have about a specific domain in such a way that
    it can be understood and used in reasoning tasks by both humans and
    machines. The nature and role of models is reviewed. Focusing on conceptual
    models, we present the building blocks and mechanisms used to create them.
    Some frequent modelling issues and usual practices addressing them are
    discussed. Step-by-step examples are given, as well as a small set of
    assignments for personal practice. An introduction to ontologies as a kind
    of models supporting data access, integration, interoperability and
    application development, along with a short overview of CIDOC CRM as an
    exemplar ontology for the cultural domain, finish off the workshop. Prepared
    by Prof. Panos Constantopoulos, Athens University of Economics and Business
    &amp; Digital Curation Unit, Athena Research Centre.
