summary:
  content: "In this lecture, Jon Tennant argues that 'Open Science' is 'good
    science', because it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and public
    good. However, he argues, researchers are not rewarded for doing good
    science. Tennant asks: 'how can we all work together to kick-start a new
    culture of open scientific practices, without putting our best and brightest
    at risk? How do we want people in the future to see this pivotal time in the
    history of science?' He challenges the audience to answer the question:
    'which side do you want to be on?'"
