This video tutorial introduces the DARIAH-DE Publikator.  You will learn how to create collections and fill them with data and you will get useful information about the FAIRification of the research data life cycle, especially within the scope of DARIAH-DE.  The DARIAH-DE Publikator is a publication tool which allows you to upload your research data into the DARIAH-DE Repository and index it with metadata using Dublin Core Simple.

While there are also written guides available to familiarise yourself with the Publikator (see, for example, the <Link link={{"discriminant":"resources-external","value":"dariah-de-collection-registry-tutorial"}}>DARIAH-DE Collection Registry Tutorial</Link>), this video is an interactive way of getting to know a new tool that can help you broaden your expertise in the field of research data management.
