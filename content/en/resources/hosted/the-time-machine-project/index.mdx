As part of DARIAH's ongoing In-House Webinar series, the 'Friday Frontiers', Melvin Wevers (University of Amsterdam) and Iason Jongepier (University of Antwerp) gave us an insight into the Time Machine Project and how local Time Machine projects have brought new understanding to the social, environmental and economic history of Amsterdam and Antwerp.

In this screencast, viewers will learn about the Time Machine Project structure, and how visualisations of cultural heritage such as these can deepen an understanding of local history.
