This talk examines how key challenges in digital heritage involving 3D models could be brought to life and re-opened to interpretation by game design, and how game-like interaction could also help increase the richness and immersive qualities of XR (extended reality) and virtual tourism. Can 3D models, the scholarly information surrounding them, and the involvement of the public be brought closer together? And can we harness the speed and complexity of new technologies to ensure both the data and our understanding of that data can be recorded, interpreted, and shared more fairly, openly, and democratically?

Funded through the INTERREG NPA funded project [DACCHE](https://linktr.ee/dacche_interreg)

Event hosted by the [Centre for Digital Humanities and Arts](https://www.mshl.is) and the
[Gunnar Gunnarsson Institute](https://www.skriduklaustur.is/is/gunnarsstofnun).
