What connects analysing the creative process of a performance using 20,000 collected digital documents, reconstructing an artist's career from programme data, and preserving a touring show? The answer lies in digital traces – one of the most significant challenges for the memory of performing arts. In this Friday Frontiers webinar, Prof. Clarisse Bardiot explores the intersection of performing arts studies and digital. Following a state-of-the-art review of research in performing arts and digital humanities (literature, history, and representation analysis), the webinar addresses current challenges, including data modelling, multimodal analysis, and artificial intelligence. From preserving performances to studying creative processes and building new historiographical methods, the digital transformation reshapes how we understand and document performing arts.
