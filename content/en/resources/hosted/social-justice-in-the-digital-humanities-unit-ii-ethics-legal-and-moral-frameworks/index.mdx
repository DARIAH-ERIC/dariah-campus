#### **Introduction**

Researchers working in Digital Humanities are becoming increasingly aware of a panoply of ethical considerations involved in their research. These include issues relating to data privacy, cultural sensitivity, accessibility, transparency, and representation. These questions are in addition to more traditional ethical considerations within the humanities such as providing due consideration to previous scholarship. But as humanities researchers have moved from being consumers of scholarship as well as the infrastructures in which that scholarship exists (eg databases, metadata, knowledge systems) to developers of infrastructure, from remediation of the physical to the digital, the development and use of standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative, the creation of databases, and the expansion of existing metadata schema, new ethical, moral, and legal considerations emerge.

Digital Humanists regularly navigate complex ethical considerations related to translation and representation, including issues of cultural sensitivity, accuracy, and the potential for misrepresentation. These issues are particularly important in the context of DH research, which often involves the use of digital tools and methods that may impact the representation of individuals and communities. Moreover, DH scholarship must be mindful of the intersection between ethics and the law, particularly with respect to issues such as data privacy, intellectual property, and informed consent. DH scholars must ensure that their research practices not only comply with local, national, or international law and regulation, but it is incumbent upon researchers to engage in critical reflection on the ethical implications of their work.

Questions that guide such research might include how can we ethically collect and use data in our projects. What steps can be taken to ensure that our scholarship respects diverse cultures and perspectives? Additionally, it is important to consider the potential biases that can emerge in DH projects and how best to mitigate them. Researchers need to balance between the requirements of the open science movement and considerations for the privacy and cultural sensitivity of the data they work with (Lawson 2019). Moreover, adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) becomes paramount in ensuring that digital data and resources are not only open but also usable and sustainable in the long term. And lastly, one should be aware of the power dynamics involved in data collection, algorithmic decision-making, and digital representation. By recognizing these challenges, it is possible to create projects that are fair, inclusive, and respectful, as well as understand how ethical issues were dealt with when utilising the projects created by others.

By adopting ethical principles in their research practice, digital humanists can contribute to a more ethical and just digital landscape. As the case studies in this section demonstrate, ethical considerations are not a set of rigid rules, nor a fixed set of methods, but rather an ongoing process of critical thinking and reflection guided by a commitment to integrity, social responsibility, and the well-being of all stakeholders involved. As such, ethical research revolves around three key concepts: ethics, morality, and legal frameworks.

For many researchers, especially those who receive grant funding, it is increasingly necessary to apply for institutional ethics approval before beginning one’s research. Nicholas Proferes (2020) describes this adherence to ethical standards as compliance. Compliance within an ethical framework is about mitigating institutional risk and liability, particularly concerning human subjects, while complying with the legal framework(s) in the jurisdiction in which the research takes place. But as the case studies in this section demonstrate, ethical considerations in digital scholarship increasingly go beyond these institutional reviews. This is particularly true due to rapid changes in technology, as well as moral considerations that are in flux responding to changes in society, and within one’s research community.

For example, in taking a compliance approach, researchers need to obtain informed consent from research participants, while ensuring that their research practices respect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals and communities. But Proferes also describes an alternative or additional approach -- that of ethics as contemplation:

> Ethics, in one (ideal) sense, is about using our capacities for reason and judgment to achieve ‘the good life’ vis-à-vis moral action and/or personal character. . . . Ethics as contemplation suggests an ongoing practice of inward reflection about our own actions about what is right and just.

  
Ethics as contemplation goes beyond institutional requirements to ‘the ideal we should continuously aspire towards’ (Proferes 2020).

####  **Ethical principles and values in Digital Humanities**

Digital humanists find themselves in a unique position, at the intersection of their foundational scientific disciplines and the technological solutions offered to facilitate their research efforts or advance their studies. In this convergence of disciplines, a comprehensive understanding of ethical considerations is required that extend beyond traditional academic boundaries. During the implementation of digital humanities research projects, it is crucial to adhere to the fundamental ethical codes of the relevant fields and disciplines while simultaneously respecting ethical principles arising from the digital processing, storage, and utilisation of research results.

On the one hand, respecting the rights of individuals and communities that are the subjects of research, as well as promoting responsible and ethical behaviour, has long been imperative in the humanities. Ethical research principles, encompassing respect for research participants, transparency in data collection and analysis, and ethical standards in interpreting results, are fundamental guidelines for any humanities project. They significantly influence the shaping of the entire research process. On the other hand, the development, implementation, and use of digital technologies have also long been recognized as involving different ethical issues. Bernd Carsten Stahl predicts that these ethical considerations will continue to evolve, fostering future discussions that go beyond current debates on computer ethics and artificial intelligence ethics, based on new technologies and their applications (Stahl, 2022: 65). The integration of advanced technologies into the research and advancement of humanities requires thoughtful exploration of potential biases embedded in algorithms, privacy concerns, and power dynamics that may arise, and digital humanists must be particularly cautious in this regard. They have the task not only of pushing the boundaries of knowledge but also pioneering ethically sound practices in the intricate intersection of technology and the humanities.

Social justice and ethical considerations are crucial issues in the field of digital humanities. While, on the one hand, digital humanities projects can be powerful tools for social change, on the other hand, there is a risk of reinforcing existing power structures: algorithms and technologies are not neutral. Rather, they result from a design that incorporates human values and assumptions. If “our society exhibits biases or unethical behaviour, these biases will be reflected in the data that are collected and the choices self-learning algorithms make for us and for others” (Klockmann at al., 2022). Algorithms used in research, encompassing techniques such as the analysis of large datasets, classification, filtering, natural language processing (NLP), or data visualisation, enable digital humanists to expedite research processes and gain new insights into their respective fields. However, the fundamental assumption for their proper functioning lies in the quality of the available data. If the data is biassed or incomplete, the results of analyses or decisions made can reflect these biases (Leurs, K., &amp; Shepherd, 2017) Since ‘algorithms do not have a conscience, personal preferences, or moral agency’ (Gilli et al., 2020), the responsibility lies on experts to be aware of inherent biases and actively work towards recognizing and rectifying them. Through systematic analysis and improvement of data quality, they can reduce the likelihood of reproducing biases in research outcomes or algorithm-based decisions. Such reflexivity and engagement in working with data can be pivotal in creating digital environments that foster objectivity and fairness (for more information on this topic, see the Data Feminism case study in this unit. Data Feminism, as part of the broader movement for social justice in digital humanities, recognizes that data and algorithms are not neutral).

The development of digital initiatives conceals another situation that has the potential to deepen social injustice. Namely, numerous individuals and even groups worldwide lack access to the internet, placing them in a position of disadvantage. On one hand, their limited representation in existing digital sources and projects can be observed, as well as their inability to participate in innovations. In other words, the unjust distribution of access to technology can result in further marginalisation of certain groups in the digital environment.

It is important to be aware of this power dynamic in digital initiatives and work towards ensuring accountability and transparency, constantly questioning and exploring ‘the dark side of DH (Smithies 2022). The Case Study Lights and Shadows: The PhilPeriodicals Collaboration Between the Philippines and Belgium in DH Digitization and Training provides an example of this.

There is also the issue of privacy and data security collected within the scope of research. It is crucial to ensure that data is collected and stored in ways that respect individuals' privacy and that appropriate protective measures are in place to prevent data breaches. It is thus crucial to respect and adhere to legal frameworks as there are formal sanctions for their violation. Legal frameworks encompass laws, regulations, and policies that govern the use and management of data, privacy, and intellectual property. Navigating the legal and ethical issues involved in research and the publication of research results can be challenging for a researcher. Additionally, caution should be exercised when using copyrighted materials, seeking permission when necessary. For assistance in navigating these regulations, please refer to the Toolkit Section of this course.

The digitization of cultural heritage objects raises important ethical questions about ownership, consent, and representation, and digital humanists, along with the archives and museums that house this heritage, must grapple with these challenges in their efforts to make their collections more accessible to researchers and the public. By working closely with communities and engaging in open and transparent dialogue, it is possible to take steps to address these ethical considerations and ensure that making these objects publicly available is done in an ethical and responsible manner.

Additionally, our scholarship needs to be mindful of cultural diversity and sensitivity and of the audiences who may view and/or interact with our scholarship. This is an example of Proferes’ ‘contemplative ethics’ in which researchers need to continually engage in critical reflection on the assumptions and values that underpin their research practices and avoid perpetuating universalizing or homogenising narratives.

While the field of digital humanities offers us remarkable opportunities for research and collaboration, an understanding of history, as well as contemporary life and cultural heritage, these opportunities come with responsibilities. As DH scholars and practitioners, we must navigate complex ethical landscapes to ensure that our work and our projects contribute positively to society and safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and communities.

A good place to start in working towards more ethical scholarship is through The Makkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. The centre provides a number of resources for researchers wishing to apply ethical practices to their research. These include a framework for ethical decision-making, including a short video and a poster that provides a summary of the framework.


<IframeElement w={600} h={335} alt='' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRqOWScCjJM?si=HIJIy-R-SCX_uxqA' title='YouTube video player' />
  
Other principles that can help govern the decision-making process when working with specific communities are The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. The foundation of The CARE Principles acknowledges that ‘the current movement toward open data and open science does not fully engage with Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests (for more information on the FAIR principles, see the case study in this section). The Principles acknowledge that as researchers working with indigenous communities and/or their cultural patrimony, we are confronted with conflicting ethical and moral demands:

Existing principles within the open data movement (e.g. FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) primarily focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts. The emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous knowledge for collective benefit.

For further information on The CARE Principles, see the Case Study in this unit. For an example of The CARE Principles in practice, see the Case Study Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the Researcher’s Responsibilities

Balancing openness with considerations of power dynamics, historical contexts, and respect for human rights is integral to fostering a just and ethical landscape in digital humanities research.

####  **Conclusion** 

The Case Studies in this unit are divided into two parts. The first part consists of principles, frameworks, and concepts that guide ethical practices in digital scholarship. These include Data Feminism, The FAIR Principles, The CARE Principles, and A Framework for Ethical Decision Making. The rest of the Case Studies provide examples of digital scholarship that foreground ethical practices. This unit should also be read in conjunction with The Toolkit which provides many examples of tools, software, methods, and frameworks from which to conduct ethical scholarship.

##### This case study is written by Anna Villarica and is based on the book *Data Feminism* by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. The page is also designed by Anna Villarica.

#### What is data feminism?

  
![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8fdb86ff5288b335ebde02bcb0a9d343e9e4a36e-71149.jpeg)Data feminism is the application of intersectional feminist approaches to data science. It is a framework developed by digital humanities scholars Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. In their book ‘Data Feminism’, they define it as ‘a way of thinking about data that is informed by direct experience, commitment to action, and intersectional feminist thought’ (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020, p. 8). Recognising the inequalities produced and reinforced in different stages of working with data, D’Ignazio and Klein argue for a more thoughtful and reflexive way of conducting data science work.   
  
To this end, they outline seven principles to operationalize feminism in the data sciences. These principles focus on transparency, accountability, and recognize not only the biases that feed into the data, but also the potential of using data science to challenge power. Data feminism is part of a larger push for social justice in the digital humanities. Digital humanities scholars have always worked at the intersection of the digital with humanist concerns. With emerging technologies, they are afforded new opportunities for conducting research, as well as new ways to use these tools to advance important causes.

#### Why data? 

Data has been called the new oil. Oil-related metaphors and vocabulary abound – data is a resource that can be ‘mined’, ‘processed’ and turned into profits. Powerful institutions that have the resources to harvest data can use it to their benefit. For instance, large companies like Google and Amazon are able to work with data to send targeted ads to their users. Government institutions are also able to collect and access data on citizens and base their decisions and expenditures on those. Those who hold the data wield power, similar to nations with vast amounts of oil resources at their disposal.

Data is also like oil in that it can worsen inequalities. In some cases, the discovery of oil can lead to exploitation and worse conditions for the local populations while oil companies make money. Likewise, inequalities can also arise when data procedures are applied on certain people. When data is collected on vulnerable populations, for example, it can lead to categorization and further stigmatization of such groups, at the same time benefiting the people holding the data. Algorithms based on big data have been found to be biased towards people of a certain gender or race, for example (Noble 2018; O’Neil, 2017).


<IframeElement w={640} h={170} alt='' src='https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/4BZIwFlL0IZr6kH6VUVqqx?utm_source=generator' />
*Data may be gold, but who is harmed? (Listen to the Data Fails Podcast on Spotify.)* *Ali Dunn and Jade Greer of the Data Feminism Network discuss how data has been used or misused. Applied to recruiting, the car industry, welfare and more, consequences range from hilarious to disastrous.*

  
At the same time, people tend to see data as neutral, objective and fair as they are based on numbers. Data feminists note however that data are not as objective as they appear. For D’Ignazio and Klein, a data visualization is an example of a ‘rhetorical object’ which is ‘a communicating object that reflects choices about the selection and representation of reality’ (2020, p. 78). After all, data are produced through processes of collecting, selecting, processing, interpreting and visualizing phenomena. These social contexts that give rise to that data should not be neglected. Choices are made by humans throughout these steps, leading to datasets, algorithms and visualisations that may be based on numbers, but reflect the opinions, beliefs, and biases of those who interacted with data. Given that only 15% of people in data science and analytics are female and less than three percent are people of colour (Duranton et al., 2020), we should be concerned.

####   
Why feminism?

> *"I*ntersectional feminism, when applied to the unequal balance of power in data science, can help that power be challenged, can help it be rebalanced, and ultimately help it be changed’" -Lauren Klein**   
> Feminism is concerned with equal rights for all genders. Beyond being a gender-related issue, however, feminism is concerned with power imbalances and what structural forces have caused them over a long period of time. The goal of feminism is to understand and challenge these power systems to achieve equality. Data feminism borrows from intersectional feminism in particular. Intersectional feminism, borne out of Black feminism, believes that forces of power intersect with each other and the processes of discrimination that result are complex. Structural forces contribute to discrimination or privilege which we experience, based on various factors like gender, class, race, religion and so on. These result in interlocking systems of oppression that become difficult to separate and compound each others’ effects. Data science practices likewise result in issues of inequality, power and representation, so it makes sense to apply intersectional feminist theories to them. D’Ignazio and Klein build their data feminism framework around seven principles which serve as best practices to guide people working with data.



<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/slider-of-data-feminism-principles-661' />



#### Case #1 Missing data and counterdata 

##### (Principles 1,2,5)

Data feminist practice begins by examining power structures and how that is reflected in our data and data practices. For example, what types of data are collected or not, or which ones are made publicly available, could say a lot. In our data-saturated landscape, there are datasets that are conspicuously absent. Artist Mimi Onouha examines this in her installation: The Library of Missing Datasets. Onuoha’s exhibit is a physical drawer that contains the types of data that governments choose not to spend resources on, or choose to hide. As Onuoha notes, ‘Wherever large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live…That which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to...Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences’ (Onuoha, n.d.).

Beyond examining power, research-activists are also actively using data to challenge or ‘counter’ this power. Such ‘counterdata’ practices could include compiling data sheets, publishing maps, digital storytelling and more. One concrete example is the feminicide map started by Maria Salguero in Mexico. Feminicide is the killing of women or girls due to their gender. In Mexico, an average of eight girls are killed each day. While the Mexican government has promised to clamp down on feminicide, it neglects to count and register such cases and their official feminicide data are not available in disaggregated form (D’Ignazio, 2022). Maria Salguero, a human rights activist and geophysical engineer from Mexico, decided to collect and map the data herself. She spends about three hours a day poring through sources, verifying and structuring the data in order to be able to plot them on the map. This grassroots project also involves the public (non-data experts) who can send information to Salguero. Her unofficial database is the largest publicly accessible dataset on feminicide in Mexico, helping families find missing women, supporting the work of journalists and nonprofits, and making the victims’ stories visible (D’Ignazio, 2022). Salguero’s work challenges power and contributes towards justice for the victims.

#### Case #2 Emotional and multi sensory data

##### (Principles 3,5)

In data visualization, what is missing are ‘emotion and affect, embodiment and expression, embellishment and decoration’ as these experiences have been ascribed to women and thus not as valued in society (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). We have been trained to put reason on top of emotion, and as a result data visualizations often have clean layouts, 2D and minimalist designs. D’Ignazio and Klein ask: What happens when we allow emotions back in? They advocate for the ‘visceralisation’ of data – that is, to make data that we can respond to physically and emotionally.  
  
D’Ignazio and Klein use the example of US Gun Killings visualizations to illustrate the impact of emotional data. Rather than a static visualization, this uses arcs to represent someone’s life, starting with a bright orange line, growing and growing, until the point at which they are shot and killed, turning the line to grey. Each represents a life cut short due to gun violence, and a cumulative ‘Stolen Years’ dashboard counts (based on data about potential lifespans) how many years these people as a whole did not get to enjoy. Visualisations such as these stick with viewers, as they combine reason and emotion. However, they are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to their emotional appeal.

Data is also often presented in textual 2D formats. What happens when data is turned into objects we can touch? Representing data in physical form is called data physicalization (Jansen et al., 2015). Being able to touch data also brings a different, more intimate experience of the object. Data physicalisation blurs the lines between creative, physical and conceptual exploration, ‘surfaces the labor involved with data production and representation’ (Koeser et al., 2020, p. 2), provides different perspectives and dimensions to the data, and allows the people interacting with it to be active participants (Koeser et al., 2020).  
  
This also allows more people into the realm of data science, which ties in with feminist principle five: Embracing pluralism. Through presenting data in multisensory formats, differently abled people could also participate in data science. Non-data experts such as artists and sculptors could also contribute to data science. With this, it is possible to expand our definition of data science, by bringing in the perspectives of individuals who may not be data practitioners per so, but who could contribute different ways of knowing and experiencing. Below are examples of physicalised data from the Gallery of Physical Visualizations maintained by Pierre Dragicevic and Yvonne Jansen.

##### **What is FAIR data and why does it matter?** 

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/931c973059539c6eb5d9fb42a43cc36adebb2029-71156.png)The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship, published in 2016, provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets\[1\]. They can serve to guide data producers and publishers helping to maximize the added value gained by scholarly digital publishing.\[2\]

Although originally developed in the life sciences, the FAIR principles are applicable to all research disciplines that deal with data, as they emphasise the importance of computational systems being able to find, access, interoperate and reuse data with minimal human intervention. Since their publication, the FAIR principles have been endorsed by the European Union, national funders and universities, leading to the development of data management policies, tools and infrastructures. Some projects adhere closely to the original FAIR definitions, while others are inspired by the spirit of the principles. Ensuring that data is FAIR is critical in the digital transformation space. FAIR data access is essential to enable researchers to find and access relevant data, leading to new insights and discoveries that would otherwise remain out of reach. Each letter of FAIR stands for one of the four basic principles

- **F** - **F**indable
- **A** - **A**ccessible
- **I** - **I**nteroperable
- **R** - **R**eusable

the principles can be summed up in four points:

**Both humans and machines are intended as digesters of data.**

This will lead to the creation of an ecosystem that is fast to respond to change and automatically adapts to new findings or changes: the Internet of FAIR Data and Services. This is the reason for focusing on standards for data, identification mechanisms, data availability, etc.

**The FAIR principles apply to both *data* and *metadata.***

**The principles are not necessarily about open data.**

You can and should work in a FAIR manner also with data that is not intended for public availability.

**The FAIR principles are not rules or standards.**

The FAIR principles must not be mistaken for rules or standards that you can use to evaluate tools, data, policies, etc. This would soon make the principles out-of-date and inapplicable across research disciplines. Adopting the FAIR principles will often be a gradual adaptation of work routines – but it could also be a huge leap, where you replace one type of infrastructure with another. It will be up to the different research areas and research communities to make the FAIR principles work in their respective contexts.

  
##### **FAIR data principles and how you can integrate them into your research**

***F - Make your data Findable***

**Findable**\[1\]\[3\] means that data can be easily discovered by both humans and machines. This is achieved through the use of machine-actionable metadata and keywords that can be indexed by search engines and research data catalogs. Additionally, unique and persistent identifiers, such as DOIs or Handles, are used to reference the data, and the metadata includes the identifier of the data it describes. Easy discoverability of metadata and data is crucial for enabling their (re)use, and machine-readable metadata plays a vital role in automating the process of discovering datasets and services. The Findable principle is divided into 4 'sub-principles" \[1\]

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/c56b4f784e085392da020f4462123196b24c1cf4-71157.jpg)

As you can see, the quintessence of this principle is to make data discoverable for everyone through persistent identifiers and metadata. You can do so by \[3\]

- publishing your data in searchable repositories, e.g. Zenodo, as they assign persistent identifiers to resources, and by
- adding machine-readable metadata (e.g. Dublin Core).

***A - Make your data Accessible***

**Accessibility**\[1\]\[3\], as part of the FAIR principles, ensures that users are given guidance on how to access the desired data, which may involve authentication and authorization. It means that the data is stored and can be accessed using standard procedures. While it doesn't require open availability, information on data retrieval should be provided, such as labeling data as "Access only with explicit permission" and including contact details. Ideally, this accessibility information should be machine-readable.

Similar to the Findable principle, the Accessible principle is also subdivided further \[1\]:

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/4c0c4afce474fc1db53bc6f68458ea1315af3176-71158.jpg)

To make your data accessible, you simple have to do the following\[3\]:

- have openly available administrative metadata and attach a data licence or statement to it, which informs users how they can access the data
- use a long-term storage solution for archiving, which ensures the data is retrievable by their persistant identifier using a standard protocol
- give access to metadata (always)

  
***I - Make your data Interoperable***

**Interoperability**\[1\]\[3\] guarantees the ability to exchange and utilize data across different applications and systems, even in the long term, by employing open file formats. It also entails the integration of data from various research fields, accomplished through the implementation of metadata standards, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and purposeful connections between data and associated digital research objects. Interoperability further necessitates the smooth interaction of data with analysis, storage, and processing applications or workflows.  
  
The Interoperability principle is divided in 3 sub-principles \[1\]:

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/d939aad118f077836845b3fc0f7d36b6cdb023b5-71159.jpg)

To make your data interoperable, you should \[3\]

- use standardised structural metadata in an sufficient amount
- use common standards, ontologies, terminologies, etc.
- use open, and long-term viable file formats.

  
***R - Make your data Reusable***

**Reusable**\[1\]\[3\] data in context of the FAIR principle is data, that are well-documented, curated, and provide contextual information. They adhere to community standards and have clear terms for access and reuse, ideally through machine-readable licenses. This promotes reproducibility and enables the design of new projects based on the original results. The FAIR principle aims to maximize data reuse by ensuring comprehensive descriptions of metadata and data.  
  
The Reusability principle is divided into 4 sub-principles \[1\]:

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/70d57afe67c933a4f34e250461c2a6d567c092b1-71160.jpg)

In order to make your data reusable for others, you have to\[3\]

- add the relevant contextual information
- use standardized structural metadata (incl. controlled vocabularies and ontologies used in your resp. research field)
- use open, long-term viable file formats, and
- add a machine-readable date license.

Of course, it is not always possible to comply with all the principles - also because other laws often do not always allow the principles to be applied in their entirety - but you should try to be as FAIR as possible with your data. If you want to learn more about research data management, here is a eLearning Course, which might be interesting for you.

Furthermore, in the "Tools and Tutorials" section of the Toolkit, you can find the "FAIR Data Maturity Model" - an interactive tool that helps you assess your data's FAIRness level.

##### **What does CARE mean and why does it matter?**

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/b4271ac5b538bbd45fb4ef5ab90459e9e83bf3dc-71168.jpg)Data has become a valuable global resource today, influencing power dynamics, decision-making, innovation, and commercialization. This is further magnified by the rise of artificial intelligence and the merging of biological and digital realms through data-sharing platforms. However, Indigenous Peoples have historically faced data inequities and exploitation, leading to concerns about integrating Indigenous knowledge and approaches into data practices and policies. The recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in data is part of reclaiming control over data ecosystems and narratives in an era of open data and open science. By focusing on collective benefit and equity, Indigenous Peoples can shift from being passive data subjects to active data users for development and well-being. This transformative approach empowers Indigenous Peoples to govern and shape data policies, practices, ethics, and innovation.  
  
In general, indigenous presence is widespread across over 90 countries, encompassing over 370 million individuals with diverse cultures. They strive to preserve, develop, and transmit their cultures, knowledge, and relationships with their territories and resources. However, ongoing colonization processes and the globalization of Western ideas have led to the suppression and co-optation of Indigenous knowledge systems and data. This has limited their ability to recover, develop, and sustain their knowledge, hindering their realization of human rights and responsibilities.

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance address those issues. They are a set of guidelines developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) to promote ethical and respectful management of Indigenous data. The principles emphasize the importance of respecting the cultural values, rights, and interests of Indigenous peoples in the collection, management, and use of data that pertains to them. By focusing on people and purpose, they complement other open data principles, e.g. the FAIR principles, which primarily focus on the data itself. CARE recognizes the importance of Indigenous rights and interests in data and aims to promote Indigenous innovation and self-determination. By considering both people and purpose, the CARE Principles aim to empower Indigenous Peoples and ensure their knowledge and data are valued and utilized in a way that aligns with their worldviews and benefits their communities.

CARE is also an acronym and stands for:

- **C** - **C**ollective Benefit
- **A** - **A**uthority to Control
- **R** - **R**esponsibility
- **E** - **E**thics

The implementation of the CARE Principles alongside the FAIR Principles ensures that data reflect the realities of Indigenous Peoples, remain under Indigenous control, and promote knowledge discovery and innovation. These principles guide data producers, stewards, and publishers in affirming Indigenous rights to self-determination and addressing issues such as privacy and future use. Just as the FAIR Principles promote good data management practices, the CARE Principles encourage data users to be both FAIR and CARE in their approach.\[1\]\[2\]

Like the FAIR principles, the CARE principles are subdivided further than the acronym suggests. The CARE principles consist of a total of 12 principles, which we will look at in more detail in the following section.

##### **How to implement the CARE principles**

***C - Collective Benefit***

**Collective benefit**\[3\]means that

  
> Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.\[3\]

  
The first principle emphasizes the need to prioritize the collective benefit of Indigenous communities, rather than individual interests, in the collection and use of data. This includes respecting the diversity of Indigenous communities and recognizing that their data needs and priorities may differ from those of non-Indigenous communities.  
Collective Benefit is further divided into three sub-principles, which state that the collective benefit should be:

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0a80fd6a0abbb87214107d21300d9743e4586bc4-71169.jpg)

To ensure that there is a collective benefit in light of the CARE principles:

- the use and reuse of data by Indigenous people should be actively supported and promoted by governments and institutions
- the Indigenous community should benefit from the data (e.g. enhancement of engagement, support regarding service and policy needs, transparency, and better decision-making)
- the data is grounded in the community.

  
***A - Authority to Control***

**Authority to Control**\[3\] means, that

  
> Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.

  
The second principle emphasizes the need for Indigenous peoples to have control over their data, including the right to determine who can access their data and for what purposes. This principle also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting Indigenous data sovereignty, or the right of Indigenous peoples to govern their data according to their cultural values and norms.  
  
Authority to Control is also divided into 3 sub-principles:

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/0793de478e46f8dc9cf10456caba2472b197f9f8-71170.jpg)

For the data to fulfill this principle,

- indigenous rights and interest in the indigenous data and knowledge must be recognized and implemented in policies
- indigenous data must be available and accessible for indigenous people
- indigenous people should be active leaders in the stewardship of the data

  
***R - Responsibility***

**Responsibility**\[3\] means, that

  
> Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self determination and collective benefit.\[3\]

  
The third principle emphasizes the need for all parties involved in the collection, management, and use of Indigenous data to act responsibly and with care. This includes promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance, and ensuring that data is used in ways that respect the cultural values and rights of Indigenous peoples.   
  
The Responsibility principle is divided into three sub-principles, which say that you should be responsible

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/c1ff3d4fd6342fa097259f3ca77f63bf3ff9031d-71171.jpg)

To act responsibly with indigenous data:

- relationships and the data creation should be built on trust, respect, reciprocity, and a mutual understanding
- the usage of the data should foster the data literacy in the community
- resources must be designed to generate data based on the worldviews and languages of indigenous people

  
***E - Ethics***

 **Ethics**\[3\] in light of the CARE principles means, that

  
> Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.\[3\]

  
The fourth principle emphasizes the need for ethical considerations to guide the collection, management, and use of Indigenous data. This includes respecting the privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy of Indigenous individuals and communities, as well as the need to avoid using data in ways that may cause harm or perpetuate discrimination or bias.   
  
Like its predecessors, the Ethics Principle is divided into 3 sub-principles, which state that ethical considerations should be

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/a54ab21aa28d03eaa2188d8355860f5ef5db1332-71172.jpg)

To work ethically with indigenous data, you have to ensure, that

- the data does not stigmatize the communities, cultures and their knowledge
- ethical risk assessments should be done beforehand and from the perspective of the resp. community
- imbalances in power and resources are addressed in the ethical processes
- ethical processes include representatives of the resp. communities
- metadata should state and acknowledge the provenance and purpose of the data as well as limitations and obligations of use

  
The CARE Principles are crucial in rectifying historical injustices around Indigenous data. By respecting Indigenous rights, values, and interests, these principles not only guide data handling but also serve as a beacon for ethical and respectful engagement, ensuring that data practices reflect the diverse realities of Indigenous cultures and contribute positively to their communities.

#### **Introduction**

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/84abdf427a04ce0c776576a5971b9cb1596b019d-71185.png)Digitization has facilitated access to the historic record in unprecedented ways. Yet many records, even in their digital form, remain difficult to use. What if users had access not only to the image but also to the text within the image? It was with this in mind that the Center for Digital Scholarship at the American Philosophical Society launched its Open Data Initiative (ODI). Under this initiative, CDS staff create datasets from APS collections focusing primarily on historic documents that are rendered more useful when computer readable. Opening up these documents to computational analysis permits unprecedented access and can help us gain a better understanding of the past. However, some datasets present complex challenges that practitioners of open data must consider before releasing data to the world.  
  
Take for example the Record of Indenture–an amazing resource of over 5,000 indenture records. Each record consists of a name, country of origin, length of contract, debt owed, and details on the terms of the indenture. This is extremely rich and valuable data. But users should be aware that each data point actually represents real human beings, who lived real lives, often under great duress. In most cases, the only information we have about them was captured, without consent, by someone who held a significant amount of power over them.

Data is great for producing new scholarship and facilitating conversation. It can also reinforce structural harms, biases, and inequalities. Approaching data with empathy has become the guiding principle of the ODI. This case study highlights Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America, a digital project that takes a humanistic approach to open data and explores what it means to represent the human experience quantitatively.

#### **Legacy Data and Data Legacies**

CDS had previously produced structured data versions of historical documents to increase their accessibility, including records from Eastern State Penitentiary and the postal records of Benjamin Franklin during his tenure as Postmaster of Philadelphia. These data projects had complexities, but the data behind the ODI project that became Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America was much more challenging and required more nuance in approach. Sourced from a historical document entitled “Record of indentures of individuals bound out as apprentices, servants, etc., and of German and other redemptioners, 1771 October 3 - 1773 October 5,” some of the hurdles we faced turning this document into structured data involved missing, incomplete, and/or inaccurate entries as well as contemporary power differentials which influenced the data’s original collection. Therefore, a careful approach was necessary not only to ensure the integrity of the data produced and the knowledge derived from it but also to facilitate a humanistic process that we hoped would minimize any perpetuation of harm embedded in the original records.  
   
We had to confront these hurdles early on. The transcription process of the Record of Indentures ledger revealed something that often doesn’t become visible until the analysis/knowledge production stage of dealing with data: the subjectivity of the information at hand. Firstly, a number of pages missing from the ledger as well as some hard-to-decipher handwriting necessitated the supplemental use of a previously published version of the ledger, put out by the German Society of Pennsylvania (GSP) in 1907. Created primarily for use by genealogists, this volume was differently structured and did not include all information fields present in the original ledger. A close comparison also revealed alteration of the ledger’s contents in the GSP volume - one example being the omission of the names of women, sometimes recorded simply as “wife.” The context of the GSP rendering of the ledger’s data is now apparent, it was easier to see the biases, limitations, and embedded power relationships therein.![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/8ed9a2aa380303d7553bd92a162b678d01061a4c-71186.jpg) *The women’s names in the ledger were often neglected and recorded simply as “wife”. Indentures from the “Record of indentures of individuals bound out as apprentices, servants, etc., and of German and other redemptioners”.*

*Listen to Dr. Loukissas talk about the difference between data sets and data settings, and why it matters.*This was a stark reminder of the power relations that are always at play in the creation of any dataset and the human stories that can be lost to time as a result. One of our aims was to consider the ledger’s data critically and with care, which Yanni Loukissas notes “is critical in that it calls attention to neglected things” (Loukissas, 2019). To do that, we looked at what Loukissas (2019) calls a “data setting”, examining the context of the original ledger by asking who created the ledger’s entries to begin with, and why. The ledger’s data setting - a document created by government employees as a legal record to enforce business contracts and property claims - made evident the numerous biases present in this information and the absence of equitable representation of those human beings about whom the data was recorded. This data was “made of bodies,” in the words of D’Ignazio and Klein (2020). We are humanists, and we recognize that data, especially when decontextualized, can cause direct or indirect harm to the privacy, safety, or well-being of source individuals, communities, traditions, and cultures, especially those which have been or are subjected to marginalization. And our role as stewards means that, in addition to “protecting” the data at hand from losing its integrity and value, we also have the responsibility of anticipating the damage that the \*data\* could do from beyond the grave.  
  
#### **Humanistic Approaches to Data**

Once processed, the data from the Record of Indentures was used to produce visualizations that form the foundation of our online exhibition. Early in the process, we decided to present the macro-level view of the data set through visualizations which allowed us to understand a typical contract, and thus also to isolate any outliers or unusual practices, along with the micro-level, which we took to be single data points which are, in other words, the individual stories that together comprise the Records.  
  
Each visualization thus acts as a window into the dataset, serving as a source of historical context, and each personal story serves as a mechanism to counteract a perceived absence of emotion that visualizations can facilitate. The Record Book of Indentures is filled with feeling; the pages capture the experience of five thousand individuals during a time in their life that would likely have involved a complex mix of emotions; hope, anxiety, sorrow, adventure, and hardship; their journey being far more than a line or dot in a visualization. To elide this fact would be to present only partial truth.  
  
![Length of Indenture ](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/5a901274618662873e91d3bd06bbda647a8f1d51.png)

 *These charts demonstrate the number of years each person had to serve under the contract of indenture. (Source: The digital collection Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America)*  
To best illustrate our approach to humanizing this dataset, we can turn to the case of Catherine Biesman whose contract of indenture was unusually long at 26 years, a fact that became clear in the production of the visualization above. Catherine’s record below shows that on August 1, 1772, she was indentured as a servant to James Smith, a contract that turned out to be a continuation of an initial agreement signed on September 17, 1771, with George Michael Kraft.

(Source: The digital collection* *Investigating Indentured Servitude: Visualizing Experiences of Colonial America**)*Our analysis of the dataset shows the average length of indenture to be four years. The length of Catherine's contract was 26 years - an unusually long period of time. Further investigation uncovered mention of Catherine in another dataset where we learn that she had previously resided in the Philadelphia Alms House. The record described Catherine as “mulatto”, a term used in the 18th Century for a person of mixed race and one that illuminates the inherently racialised structure of society at that time. Catherine’s contract was later transferred back to Kraft and she moved to the Northern Liberties area of Philadelphia to learn "Housewifery, to read in the bible, to write a legible hand, to sew plain work". Unfortunately, we can find no further information about Catherine. But, reading about this small part of her life personalises the dataset and allows us to appreciate a fraction of the emotion contained in its pages. We can understand that the visualizations remove us from the reality of the lived experience of the individuals they represent. In the exhibition currently, we have pieced together, from various sources, snapshots of the lives of three people within the Indenture Records. There remain over five thousand further records to explore.  
  
#### **Conclusion**

This case study has shown just one approach to open data. We were, and remain, excited about the potential uses of this data as it has the potential to tell thousands of stories and reveal new knowledge about migration, labor, and exploitation. However, the data can be extremely sensitive and we are both aware and concerned about the risks of excavating it from historic documents. While we offer a humanistic and empathetic approach to this data, on the other hand, it has the potential to be used for the wrong reasons. Such is the nature of data and of archives.

Addressing these impacts and moving towards decolonisation takes many forms. Access to and control of all research data is one of many acts of decolonisation. Far more than a matter of asserting rights of ownership over cultural materials or ideas, data ownership represents a strong and dynamic connection between empowerment, cultural continuity, social cohesion, and resilience. A historically exploitative and “extractive” industry (Kovach 2005, 2010), research practices have a far too long history of inequity characterising Indigenous/non-Indigenous relations.   
  
The management of research data is a particularly pressing issue for Indigenous leaders, scholars, and communities\[1\], given the vital connection between data and self-governance. The control of research materials is a foundational assertion of Indigenous nations’ and communities’ rights, including rights of ownership (FNIGC 2007). The misappropriation of cultural knowledge and problematic usage of Indigenous research data has further spurred Indigenous peoples, communities, and their allies to advocate for and advance the development, application, and implementation of research principles, protocols, and best practices as a means of establishing and rigorously reinforcing transparent and ethical standards in Indigenous research data management. And, as open access and research data management are becoming necessary components of research activity (see for example, Canada’s Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy), there is the concomitant need to ensure that historical inequities do not similarly emerge in contemporary data management practices.

This case study offers an entry point to explore what Indigenous data sovereignty means in relation to research and creative practices. In exploring these issues, I hope that it helps you further understand our collective responsibility as researchers and scholars to the communities and individuals with whom we work.  
  
The case study is based on my own research and my navigation of the scope of considerations in Indigenous data management and sovereignty. I invite you to examine the possibilities, as well as the challenges, in establishing and following the highest standards of ethical, transparent, and sustainable principles and practices of data management toward ensuring Indigenous data sovereignty.   
  
#### **What is Data Sovereignty?**

Indigenous data sovereignty (IDSOV) is an assertion of Indigenous jurisdiction over all data about First Peoples, including information held by non-Indigenous governments and institutions. The global movement for Indigenous data sovereignty affirms the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to control how information about them is managed, accessed, and preserved (Carroll et al., 2020; FNIGC, 2014).   
  
![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/56d3bd0512704120cf79c49e879bc4482f78e0d0-71204.jpg)  
The international Indigenous data sovereignty movement, which includes networks such as the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) and intellectual property initiatives such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Biocultural (BC) labels, offers comprehensive guidelines to assist in the implementation of Indigenous data sovereignty. In Canada, the OCAP® principles, outlined below, are the best known and while these principles generally apply as well to the Inuit and Métis Nations, these nations have developed their own research data management protocols (See for example, the National Inuit Strategy on Research).   
  
#### **Why is Indigenous Data Sovereignty Important?** 

1. ##### **Indigenous Nations and Communities**

“The term sovereignty refers to the fact that Indigenous Nations are sovereign in their governance and that extends to their data and knowledges as well. It recognizes that Indigenous people are the ultimate authority in their data and Knowledges and aims to redefine Indigenous peoples' relationship to research from being participants or subjects to being meaningful partners and co-researchers.” (University of Toronto Libraries - Indigenous Studies Research Guide, 2023)  
  
Indigenous peoples are the ultimate authority of their own data and possess the inherent right to control information about themselves. Whereas research practices have, in the past, varied from ethically sound to unmitigatedly exploitative, few considered matters of ownership and access in research agreements. Communities are now spelling out the terms of research engagement, including data ownership, usage, storage, and access as an inherent part of any research project. See for example: Indigenous Knowledges &amp; Data Governance Protocol.  
2. ##### **Researcher**

Indigenous research data sovereignty is a first principle of research engagement and foundational to research for and with Indigenous peoples and communities. Indigenous data sovereignty neither begins nor ends with the research itself. At the most basic level, researchers, when working with human participants, must follow research ethics protocols. In addition to these protocols and whether working with human participants or not, researchers must ensure that their work meets or exceeds the highest standard of research integrity. This process begins well in advance of the research phase and may involve a research ethics board of the researcher’s home institution and of the Indigenous nation with whom they will be working. Whether working with an Indigenous nation, community, group, or organisation, this includes following all of the requisite research protocols prior to engaging in any research activity, including an appropriate and agreed upon research data management plan. This may include any necessary memorandum of agreement, contracts, management of intellectual property rights, and/or the clarifying the parameters for the use of data. Researchers must ensure that the protocols are being followed for as long as is required. In that process, researchers must make every effort to ensure that the data or stories being shared, artefacts used, or lands explored have a clear set of practices regarding ownership of the data, its current use and future access, including publication rights and storage management and costs. Researchers must, in other words, collaboratively plan for as many contingencies as possible before, during and after any research is conducted and with a clear research data management plan in place.  
  
#### **Basic Principles  


OCAP® and CARE principles and values are the de facto current standards of research engagement, and are shaping, refining, and re-defining ethically sound research with Indigenous populations in Canada. The principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession/Stewardship, in particular, affirm First Nations’ control of data collection processes and that they own and control how this information can be accessed, used and stored (FNIGC 2019; First Nations Centre 2007).   


<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-ocap2-614' />

  
In Canada there are a range of data sovereignty initiatives being undertaken by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit researchers, research organisations, and governments. As noted above, best known is OCAP® which was created in 1995 as a set of foundational principles to guide the standardisation of the processes for First Nations’ ownership and control over data, including its collection, access, use and storage. As a political and practical response to the use of data in reproducing colonial relations, the OCAP® principles assert Indigenous sovereign research data governance (Schnarch 2004; FNIGC 2014a, b; Espey 2002; First Nations Indigenous Governance Centre 2007).   
  
“The First Nations principles of OCAP® establish how First Nations’ data and information will be collected, protected, used, or shared. Standing for ownership, control, access and possession, OCAP® is a tool to support strong information governance on the path to First Nations data sovereignty. Given the diversity within and across Nations, the principles will be expressed and asserted in line with a Nation’s respective world view, traditional knowledge, and protocols.” https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/  
  
The CARE principles of Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics were developed by the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group. Working “in consultation with \[international groups of\] Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organisations, and governments, the CARE principles were developed to be people- and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)” (Carroll et al 2020; see also Kukutai &amp; Taylor 2016)\[2\].  
  
#### **From Principles to Practice  


OCAP® was developed as “principles in evolution” rather than a “set of rules” or practices and with the understanding that there may be ambiguities or limitations in its application (FNIGC 2007). The overarching goal of OCAP®is to be as straightforward and transparent as possible, working towards a collaborative framework that adheres to “a Nation’s respective world view, traditional knowledge, and protocols” (FNIGC 2014). Moving from principles to practice is critical, however, and requires considerable attention to the specific details of a given research project.  
  
Moving from principles to practice offers researchers an opportunity to collaboratively develop an appropriate data management framework. The framework may be very straightforward, involve few consultations, and provide a clear path to ensuring a community’s priorities and protocols have been met. Researchers must nonetheless be aware of potential challenges or mitigating factors that will emerge in the process of moving from principles to practice.   
  


<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-principles-to-practice-613' />

  
In moving from principles to practice, in other words, are we actively rethinking the standards of research engagement with our collaborators and research partners. When initiating a project, the researcher must collaboratively and transparently ensure the implementation of best practices in the management of research materials. And, when research was completed long before Indigenous data sovereignty principles and guidelines were established, researchers should consider how to update their research agreements in order to implement data sovereignty best practices.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/7c94a61c5441fbbeb259cd544bf17afb61bece16-71203.png)I began working with the Whapmagoostui First Nation (WFN) in the late 1980s. The WFN are Iiyiyu, or Cree, of Iiyiuyu Istchee - the peoples’ land - whose community is located on the Hudson Bay coast just north of the 55th parallel in Nunavik (northern Québec), Canada. After receiving permission to conduct a research project on the concept of health from an Iiyiyu perspective (see Adelson 2000 and Adelson, Mickelson, Kawapit 2021), I spent 18 months living in the Whapmagoostui community and, with the help of two translators, interviewing unilingual Cree-speaking elders. This research resulted in the publication of *Being Alive Well: Health and the Politics of Cree Well-Being* (U Toronto Press 2000) and its impact was realised, in particular, in the transformation of the language and practices of health care communication at the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (see Shrivastava et al 2020 and Miyupimaatisiiun Department).   
  
Decades later, on reviewing the richness of the detail in the narratives recorded and their transcriptions and in light of my commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty, I could neither destroy nor leave the research records unattended in a filing cabinet drawer. Bringing this issue to the attention of the then-Chief of the WFN, we began to develop a plan for digitising, transferring ownership, and archiving those records.   
  
Before any of the material could be transferred to the community, it had to be available in an accessible format. I had tape recordings, printed transcripts, and photographic slides. The paper records would not survive into the future and, in storage, were not organised in a coordinated fashion with the corresponding recordings. As well, the various tape recording devices I had used at the time - and the disks on which the transcripts were stored - were now obsolete. The organisation of the materials, digitisation, and creation of a systematic overarching organisation structure required the skills of a digital archivist (see Adelson, Mickelson, Kawapit 2021 for a summary of the process). Samuel Mickelson, the digital archivist who was brought on to the project, ensured that we created a clear, accessible, and catalogued data set, with the requisite preservation master, accessible files and clear metadata.

With digitisation completed, the next step was to begin the process of facilitating access to - and local preservation of - the now accessible materials. Unfortunately, the COVID pandemic, and the travel-limiting protocols which necessarily ensued, slowed this progress. We have begun to get back on track - recognising that any number of contingencies must be included in research - and research management - planning.  
In future meetings with community representatives, we will discuss the development of a data transfer protocol and access plan. The discussion of access will begin with a review of the original consent form details, including how the interviews were originally meant to be used. As general access to the interviews was not consented to in those original forms, the community will determine whether I will need to contact family members of the original participants or if the WFN has the authority to make the decision regarding opening access beyond the requirements of the original project. Once that issue is resolved, we will then be able to discuss community and research access protocols, including whether all materials will be available to all members of the community or if any limitations will be set. This will also necessarily entail a discussion of whether there is a need for a content management system (CMS) to facilitate modifiable access. Finally, we will take into consideration the infrastructure needs, including how and where to house the data, who will manage the access, and if there are any long-term concerns regarding updates and future technologies.

One very interesting example of a content management system (CMS) that has been designed specifically for Indigenous communities is Mukurtu. Mukurtu, developed by the Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation (Washington State U) is a free, open-source platform created specifically for the needs of Indigenous communities. What is particularly interesting about Mukurtu is that is it built to “provide differential access to community members and the general public and to create space for traditional narratives and knowledge labels that foreground Indigenous knowledge in the metadata of digitised cultural heritage materials” (https://humanitiesforall.org/projects/mukurtu-an-indigenous-archive-and-publishing-tool). The Mukurtu CMS ensures that Indigenous communities decide the level and type of access based on their unique requirement and knowledge organisation categories.   
  


<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ids-principles-to-practice-610' />

  
I would like to note that with regard to the last point above, intellectual property (IP) rights originally ensured that I am the owner of my own research. In other words, IP rights privilege individual ownership and tangible heritage: I own what I write (until such time that my ownership shifts to public domain access). In practice, however - and in particular in the context of working with an Indigenous nation and community - these IP rights effectively complicate my ability to transfer that ownership to the WFN community. In order to ensure their ownership of what is currently “my” research (but, in truth, the community members’ own narratives), I will work with the WFN to draw up a memorandum of understanding which will outline the community’s rights to that intellectual property.   
  
Memoranda of Understanding are becoming more common as Indigenous communities and researchers work to address the limitations of intellectual property rights and establish more suitable terms of ownership and access.   
  
I will continue to work with the WFN to develop a memorandum of understanding and to collaboratively implement it towards a transfer of ownership as well as the transfer of all of the digitised data and their use, control and storage as they see fit.

2.7 Safe Havens for Archives at Risk
</LessonPageTitle>

<LessonPageContent>

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/af7b9dd9ef9e74c5c061ce9d0da17888e1468b90-71229.png)

#### Archives at risk



<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/putin-039-s-war-on-ukraine-039-s-archives-608' />

An archive is an institution that collects, preserves, researches and enables use of records/documents and other material of lasting value generated by the activities of state bodies and institutions, organizations, individuals and families who have had a prominent role in history, communities, and media. Records can take many forms such as reports, registers, letters, photographs, films, maps, digital files and other primary sources (National Archives, 2016).   
  
As witnesses to the past, these provide ‘evidence, explanation and justification both for past actions and current decisions’. (ICA, 2016, para. 1). These documents facilitate education, research and good governance. Archives also help us understand our cultures and build our sense of identity (Cambridge, n.d.).   
  
Sometimes, archives are threatened in their country of origin, as can be seen in recent headlines from war zones in Sudan and Ukraine. In such cases, archives and other centres of knowledge become strategic targets. Read the flipcard on the right to find out more about these archives at risk in 2023.  
  
Archives may also be at risk due to natural disasters, climate change, or their presence in areas of unstable governance. Archival records in the Marshall Islands, for example, are under threat from sea level rise and extreme weather events. In the video below, people working with the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims Tribunal discuss the importance of preserving such records. These records have been placed elsewhere for safekeeping. They are now digitally archived in the city of Girona in Spain (audio and video files) and the Swiss Federal Archives (paper files like claim documents and reference materials). This account from the Marshall Islands is among those presented at the 2015 Securing Archives at Risk conference in Bern, laying the foundation for what would later become the Safe Havens for Archives at Risk initiative.

*Bill Graham and Cathy Debrum Wakefield, from the Marshall Islands Nuclear Tribunal, explain the importance of preserving tribunal records*#### Controversies

As can be seen in the Marshall Islands example, a transfer of archives may be necessary in order to save unique records from destruction. This entails removing the archives from a sending institution and moving them to a receiving or hosting institution. These receiving institutions will provide a safe haven for these important archival materials. However, the transfer of archives from one country to another, no matter how well-intentioned, can be controversial. Issues about access and ownership arise, as well as the asymmetrical relationships between the sending institution and the hosting institution. In the past, archival rescue has been used as a rationale to transfer valuable artefacts from poorer countries to richer ones (Sutton, 2021, p. 87).

In the absence of guidelines on access and return and proper documentation, it can become difficult to recover deposited materials from hosting institutions later on. This is the case for El Salvadorian archives housed in the United Nations archives, for instance. When the transfer was made, the duration was not specified, nor who was allowed to transfer the archives back to Ecuador. As a result, the records remain at the UN archives 26 years later despite Ecuador’s requests (p. 93). A set of clear guidelines prior to the transfer thus becomes necessary to address or avoid such issues. While archival rescue has been on the minds of archivists for a long time, the push to establish the necessary guidelines was crystallized in 2016.

#### Safe Havens for Archives at Risk 

The Safe Havens for Archives at Risk initiative is responsible for the development of these Guidelines. The initiative is helmed by the peace research institute swisspeace. Swisspeace is mandated by the Swiss government to coordinate this initiative.   
  
The guidelines have been developed by an international Working Group – representatives of international and governmental institutions and NGOs that met at a congress in 2016 – that has since become an Advisory Committee in 2019.   
  
The Advisory Committee works on developing the topic of safe havens for at-risk archives, advising swisspeace in requests from sending institutions and helping these find suitable hosts (Safe Havens for Archives at Risk, n.d.). Explore the timeline to understand the development of this initiative and guidelines.

#### The Guiding Principles

Eighteen principles were agreed upon. These “Guiding Principles for Safe Havens’” for Archives at Risk are ‘a set of principles providing guidance on archival and ethical factors to be taken into account when planning the transfer of analogue or digital archives (or copies) to another institution for safekeeping’ (Sutton, 2021, p.87). After some drafts and revisions, this is the final version:

Archiving Reproductive Health (ARH) is a Wellcome-funded project coordinated by the Digital Repository of Ireland, which is working to preserve digital material created by grassroots organisations working for reproductive justice in Ireland, especially during the 2018 referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution. To date, Archiving Reproductive Health has published collections from key organisations that were involved with the campaign, and a range of oral history interviews with feminist and reproductive rights activists working in Ireland over the last 40 years. The project will continue until the end of 2023 and the collections it creates are safely deposited in the Digital Repository of Ireland for the long term.

The Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) is a national Trustworthy Digital Repository (TDR) for Ireland’s humanities, cultural heritage, and social sciences data. DRI has been certified by the CoreTrustSeal since 2018, building on our established role as a TDR. We support best practice in digital archiving, digital preservation, Open Access, Open Research, and FAIR data sharing. The DRI has pioneered the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in Ireland in the context of a trustworthy and certified repository for social sciences and humanities data.

Some FAIR data policies used by DRI and ARH include: consistent application of persistent identifiers including DOIs and ORCIDs, rich and standardised metadata that is indexed and searchable, promoting the use of vocabularies, and licences for reuse. In September 2022 Archiving Reproductive Health won a Digital Preservation Award, the prestigious National Records of Scotland Award for Safeguarding the Digital Legacy. This award celebrates initiatives for the practical application of tools to protect at-risk digital objects.

####   
Context

##### The Eighth Amendment 

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/10e3f2d82f3095ac7a287c0e6949fb7fc8476fe6-71254.jpg)*March for Choice, 2016 by Renee Summers, taken from the front of the march, showing a row of Abortion Rights Campaign activists holding a large banner. (Source: DRI)*

Many countries around the world have seen mobilisations of people for progressive change in recent years, and Ireland is no exception. In 2018, the Irish public voted in a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution. The Eighth Amendment, enacted by another referendum in 1983, placed a constitutional block on the right to legal abortion care in Ireland (although women in Ireland continued to travel to Britain and other places to access abortion care).

When the referendum took place, on 25 May 2018, it passed by 66.4%, with every constituency but one returning a majority Yes vote. Together for Yes disbanded after the referendum, and the various groups focused on the implementation of legislation. In January 2019, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was enacted, making elective abortion care legal in Ireland for the first time in the nation’s history.

In the lead-up to the referendum, there were a number of campaigns from grassroots organisations and volunteers which took place primarily over social media. In particular, a number of initiatives emerged whose aim was to tell stories of personal experiences of abortion. These collected and published stories from ordinary women, giving a voice to a previously silent group, and developing a public capacity to empathise with their experiences. One such initiative is the In Her Shoes Facebook page. Preserved in ARH’s Core Collections, In Her Shoes is particularly important to archive as it captures personal ‘hidden histories’, the silent suffering of women, the shame and stigma associated with abortion and captures a time of emerging social change.

##### Social justice movements and the digital

Social justice movements in recent years rely heavily on digital content, which is vulnerable to loss and decay as physical material (in some cases more so). Moreover, there is no consensus on the best practice for archiving social media posts, hosted as they are on a variety of platforms each with their own rules about exporting and reposting content elsewhere. The rich record of how this referendum campaign unfolded, and of how volunteers and community groups contributed to the national conversation, is at real risk, therefore, of being lost to us forever as social media accounts close, platforms change or go out of business or we simply lose track of where the information exists.

Archiving Reproductive Health intends to provide long-term preservation and access to the many at-risk archives generated by grassroots women’s reproductive health movements during the campaign. The work ARH is carrying out ensures that part of this story of Irish recent history is preserved for future generations to learn from. Those who took part in the campaign, including people who told their stories of the experience of being unable to access abortion care in Ireland, have the record of their stories and lived experience preserved and recognised. The ARH project is partially motivated by a desire to circumvent institutional 'forgetting;' which too commonly happens around grassroots social movements. We also believe that traditionally women’s organisations have largely been excluded from archives and the focus of the project is to collect and preserve women’s experiences. The research we have carried out, not only on the technical challenges, but also on the complex issues of copyright, licensing and data protection with recent digital material, will hopefully help future projects carrying out similar work.

####   
Core Collections

ARH is preserving collections of design and publicity material from activist groups, as well as a sequence of stories from the popular Facebook page ‘In Her Shoes’. Research data collections in the form of oral history interviews with medics, campaigners, and women’s rights activists are also collected. These provide important records of the lived experiences of activists and people affected by issues of reproductive inequality in Ireland.

The project is continuously publishing material over the course of its operations in 2022 and 2023. Much of the material will already be familiar to the public from the 2018 referendum campaign, but the scheduled publication of administrative documents such as meeting agendas, strategic plans and annual reports gives the public richer and deeper context, as well as providing an invaluable resource for researchers. Explore the slider to get an overview of the key stakeholder organisations that ARH is collecting material from and the various collections.



<H5PWrapper path='social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/archiving-reproductive-health-stakeholders-664' />


##### Administrative documents 

The second tranche of published material in the ARH project focuses on publications and administrative documents created by stakeholder organisations, including reports, policy papers, and general meeting agendas and minutes from the Abortion Rights Campaign, and policy publications from Together for Yes and Terminations for Medical Reasons. The evolution of the Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment can be traced through submissions to international bodies such as the Commission for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to public consultations held by the Irish government, and through collections of testimony from ordinary people affected by the Eighth Amendment.

####   
Additional Collections 

A number of additional collections have also been preserved as part of the ARH project. These include material by other volunteer organisations, researchers and campaigning groups.

The voices of activists from the past are heard in a series of oral history interview transcripts, taken from interviews with reproductive rights activists in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s, crucial years for the development of the Irish pro-choice movement. These interviews were conducted by scholars and activists Linda Connolly and Mary Muldowney, and their inclusion in the Archiving Reproductive Health project adds to present and future researchers’ understanding of this period. More recent activists’ voices come from qualitative data compiled by academic Camilla Fitzsimons, from questionnaires conducted in 2015, 2020 and 2021, which provide insights into activists’ thinking on campaigning pre and post the 2018 referendum.

####   
Public Collection Day

Archiving Reproductive Health, in partnership with Archives Ireland and Informa, held a Public Collection Day in Dublin City Library and Archive, Pearse St, Dublin, on 10 March 2023. This event was part of the public outreach aspect of ARH, and at the event we worked to digitise a cross-section of personal memorabilia relating to the history of the Eighth Amendment, and of reproductive health in Ireland more generally, over the last few decades.Members of the public applied to take part in a one-day event in Dublin on 10 March 2023. At this event, the successful applicants brought material which was digitised on-site by expert staff from Archives Ireland and Informa, or was transferred to DRI’s servers using secure file transfer.   
  
DRI staff worked with applicants to collect important information about the material, which was then used for cataloguing. After the event, the digitised material is being published on DRI as part of the ARH collection, ensuring it is preserved in the long-term. Applications were open to everyone, and we sought material relating to any aspect of the history of the Eighth Amendment and the history of reproductive health and activism in Ireland more generally. Explore the dropdown for samples of the collections published from material digitised on the Collection Day:

Publications and Resources

##### Ethics Protocol

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6152dcdea8cc31c845f5b18533215b3193d1b803-71255.png)*Photo of the first page of* *The Ethics Protocol.*

  
The project team developed an 'Ethical Protocol' for the project spelling out the ethical challenges and clearly explaining our decisions to addressing each of these challenges. The purpose of the protocol are (1) to ensure the quality and integrity of our research and archiving processes, (2) to outline the ethical issues which arise from this project and provide solutions to these challenge, and (3) to ensure transparency in the project.

The protocol was published alongside the initial launch of the collection on 8 March 2022. Secondly, in order to inform those who had posted to the Facebook page, we developed an FAQ document explaining the archiving procedure and what we are planning to do. This information was posted on the ‘In Her Shoes’ Facebook page and our website. It outlined that the posts on the page were being archived and answered the following questions: what will this mean? Why are we doing this? And what do I need to do? We have a contact email for anyone who had any questions or concerns about the project but we have not received any emails to date.

There have been no queries or requests for the take-down of any story to date. Those who request access to the collection must agree a legal agreement on the DRI repository website (End User Agreement) which states that they must ‘agree to use the digital objects only in accordance with this End User Agreement’ and ‘ensure that full compliance with all data protection laws is observed when the digital objects, or derived material, are published or presented in a public forum.’

#####   
Guide to archiving for community groups 

ARH has also published the ‘Guide to archiving digital records for volunteer and community groups’, a resource of clear, easy to follow and accessible instructions and advice for small organisations with limited resources, enabling them to make the best use of what resources they have and to preserve a cross-section of their digital records.

##### ARH Researcher Self-Care Protocol

In addition, a Self-Care Protocol for Archivists and Researchers has been developed by Dr Lorraine Grimes, the primary researcher on this project. The Self-Care Protocol includes practicalities for working with sensitive or traumatic data. It focuses on the potential to harm the researcher when working with sensitive data on reproductive health. Researchers working with collections within this project are encouraged to develop their own Self-Care protocols.

##### Conference presentations 

At the Archives Society of Alberta Biennal conference ‘Care for People in the Archives’ in Edmonton, Canada, Clare Lanigan and Lorraine Grimes presented ‘Developing a self-care protocol for working with potentially traumatic data: the Archiving Reproductive Health experience’. The presentation slides are below:

This case study is designed by Emma Prebreza and Claudio Lo Sciuto.

#### Introduction

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/6deeb4bbb000c81b1295bcabb09c4cf0faa80107-71258.jpeg)![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/d7039708256ac6de9934bd2568d8b2276c71f837-71259.jpeg)Founded in 2016 at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing, Michigan, the Global Digital Humanities (DH) Symposium began as a forum showcasing DH projects at MSU in conversation with external keynote speakers working in the intersections of the digital humanities and global issues. Since then, the Symposium has grown to include keynote speakers and presenters from around the world, as well as a dynamic Planning Committee that comprises MSU and non-MSU affiliated individuals. Through its values and actions, the event has cultivated a community which continues to simultaneously deepen and expand.

We are a DH community grounded in social justice ethos and praxis, reflected not only in the content of our symposia (with topics ranging from digital activism, climate justice, digital storytelling, anticolonial frameworks, feminist pedagogies, Indigenous rights, to archives and preservation), but also in the administration, planning, and execution of the Symposium itself. The ongoing and behind-the-scenes work to create the Symposium is as deeply important as the presentations and discussions featured during the event. The making of our Global DH Symposium is, in fact, a digital humanities project, an activation of social justice work, and a manifestation of digital humanities infrastructure and ecosystem.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/786b1bd0616cab5a20458980ce324fa99be5d20d-71260.jpg)  
In this case study, we will share several areas of Symposium planning and management that exemplify the ways that we create this event and how our values are infused into the decisions and priorities that we make.

#### Conference-Making as Digital Humanities Work

Conferences are critical infrastructure for the facilitation, curation and creation of knowledge through which scholarly communities coalesce to inspire and empower each other to enact positive change. Considering the centrality of conference attendance, presentation, and post-event publications to the development of the scholarly record and in determining scholarly reward, critiques of the power and structures of conferences (Eichmann-Kalwara et al. 2019; Estill et al. 2022; Nebiolo and Palermo 2019) are crucial to advancing an ethical field and holding infrastructure accountable to the community.

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/ce2548bd305f82ec941b19089ae651c3c353be22-71262.jpeg)*Figure 1: Presenters are located across the world (location determined by institutional affiliation at the time of presentation*  
The labor involved in the planning, organizing and executing conferences is rarely discussed as a form of digital humanities praxis. The growing episteme of critique and reflection on how DH conferences are operationalized makes clear how “inclusive representation and community diversity” are enacted and need to be thought through and overhauled (Gao et al., 2023). In 2015, digital humanists Domenico Fiormonte, Teresa Numerico, and Francesca Tomasi envisioned that within the next ten years, the field of digital humanities would see geographic expansion and the inclusion of non-Western perspectives. That decade is nearly complete, yet their vision is yet to be achieved. DH conferences, in particular, still favor white male presenters and European-focused perspectives (Eichmann-Kalwara et al., 2019).

#### Social Justice as an Imperative for Digital Humanities Conference Work

The Global DH Symposium seeks to showcase social justice-oriented and globally engaged DH works through its program while also making ethically grounded decisions in cultivating community and planning the event. With social justice as a foundation to our digital humanities conference work, we strive to make the event as global as possible. This means seriously considering what the global means in both its limitations and possibilities: understanding the problems, frictions, inequalities, and injustices that globalization brings while at the same time acknowledging the potential of a networked world made possible by digital technologies.

While many conferences in North America, historically and traditionally speaking, reinforce the marginalization of diverse voices by centering specific kinds of perspectives (often, these tend to be male and white-centric), we intentionally set out with the commitment to creating a conference that pays attention to digital humanities works with social, cultural, and political concerns indispensable to their core. We also make it a point to highlight works that may not have received much visibility in the digital humanities field or that may not be labeled as such given the field’s uneven developments in different places, especially the “Global South.”

![](/assets/content/assets/en/resources/hosted/social-justice-in-the-digital-humanities/aa69afbda397f1841195bc9cfa10edadb36bbfef-71263.jpeg)*Figure 2: Social justice word frequencies in Symposium abstracts, 2016-2024*  
As a conference community that continues to grow and learn together, we understand that social justice-oriented work is not without its challenges and is always ongoing. In an effort to adhere to our imperative of social justice, these are the key values that guide our practices.

> *This is about some of the ways we are attempting to dream ways to access care deeply, in a way where we are in control, joyful, building community, loved, giving, and receiving, that doesn’t burn anyone out or abuse or underpay anyone in the process. - Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Care Work (2018)*

*Figure 3: A selection of presentations from 2021-2023*##### Cultivating Community

The Global DH Symposium community is at the heart of everything we do. To enact and sustain social justice work, one first needs community. Building community is iterative and takes time: over the nine years since the Global DH Symposium was founded, we have cultivated a strong and vibrant network of Global DH scholars and practitioners of all levels through our annual meetings. Our consistent efforts at creating community is reflected in the number of people who return to propose, present, review, and attend year after year, in addition to the influx of new participants that every annual meeting brings.

##### Iteration and Evolution

Each year, we recruit new voices (reviewers and committee members) and retain existing ones in order to have longevity, as well as always to gain fresh perspectives. Our Planning Committee reflects this continuity and diversity, with some committee members being long-time participants of the Symposium and some being newer ones. For us, iteration and evolution means that we are always learning and trying to improve -- reinvention does not always have to be invention. We are not trying to dominate the field and not looking to be the largest conference in digital humanities; in fact, we have kept our conference intentionally small, allowing for experimentation and enabling deeper relations.

##### Equity and Inclusivity

Over the years, we have foregrounded an ethos and praxis of care at every level of running the Symposium, from pre-Symposium planning to post-Symposium reviewing: this is a vital part of equity and inclusivity being the foundations of our programming. Practicing equity and inclusivity with care takes various forms, ranging from having a set of external reviewers to help in ethical decision-making, to implementing a non-hierarchical conference, to increasing accessibility through linguistic and time zone multiplicities, and finding creative ways of fostering community beyond presentations through activities like trivia games, especially when the COVID-19 pandemic challenged how we facilitated social interactions in our virtual conferences.

Part of our work in equity and inclusivity is activating a feminist approach to making labor visible and known. In staying true to the roots of the meaning of collaboration, as both a working together and a word that has embedded within it the word labor, we strive to always accomplish best practices in appreciating and rewarding the contributions of everyone who makes this community and conference possible: the committee members, the reviewers, the translators, and the participants.

##### Planning Committee

Our Planning Committee is made up of a non-hierarchical group of scholars, librarians, archivists, postdocs, faculty, and undergraduate, high school, and graduate students from across and outside the United States, regardless of affiliation and position. The variety of backgrounds within the committee -- including new and rotating members -- allows for the Symposium to uphold its key values and ensures heterogeneous perspectives. As a committee with diverse sets of expertise, we work together in coming up with potential keynote presenters, brainstorming conference activities and engagement, and crafting the program. At the core, we are always aiming to improve how we enact our three key values.

In 2021, we launched the formation of four subcommittees within the Planning Committee, with members working collaboratively through monthly virtual meetings: Content and Publications, Technology and Volunteers, Communications and Community Building, and Local Planning. Part of our evolution as planners of the Symposium has also included experimenting with different platforms (e.g., Trello, Slack, etc.) to better manage our organization and communication.

As a global committee, we have been confronted with the following challenges: time commitment, working across time zones (US, Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.), and how to overcome practical barriers such as tax issues when sending honoraria to committee members who are not based in the United States or who have visa restrictions that restrict receiving an honorarium. The committee is a crucial component to the success of the event and serves as a nexus of community building, but supporting deep engagement is difficult amidst everyone’s limited time. Combined with the aforementioned logistical challenges, these challenges mean that we must continue to iterate to find the balance between facilitating enticing, enriching work and making the conference happen.

##### Making the Program

We welcome reviewers from around the globe (in 2024, we had a total of 50 reviewers). Each year, we invite all presenters and reviewers from the previous Symposium to become involved in the community by reviewing submissions, and we open the review opportunity to members of the Global Outlook (GO:DH) community. Additionally, we invite reviewers into the program decision-making process. This opportunity gives people an on-ramp for getting more involved in the formal planning process, and it opens up the ways of conference/academic thinking to newcomers. Finally, it brings in new voices to keep our program-planning informed by expertise from around the world.


<IframeElement w={560} h={315} alt='' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6won8itSUf4?si=HIoVMm5BS1SA6pRi' title='YouTube video player' />
  
The Symposium ran using a double-anonymous review process from 2017-2023, during which time we relied on the invisible volunteer work of several dozen reviewers as well as a laborious by-hand matching system. For the 2024 Symposium, we adopted Oxford Abstracts as a system for handling submission, reviews, registration, and communication. This system allowed us to shift to an open review process and to provide reviewer feedback to submitters. The transparency afforded by the review process improved the experience for reviewers and provided valuable insight to submitters. In the words of one of our reviewers (shared anonymously through a feedback survey): “The review process was clear and transparent; the review portal was accessible and easy to follow along; and the nesting of each of these components within the overall symposium organizing was an excellent way to model an inclusive and generative space for discourse-and community-building across both geographical and disciplinary difference.”

We engage reviewers in the program-creation process further by inviting them to the “decision-making days,” when all planning committee members and reviewers are welcome to join the virtual sessions in crafting the program and determining acceptances and rejections of submissions. Over two days, we use Zoom and an export of submissions and reviews on a Trello board, and we work through each submission together -- a human-driven and engaging (and exhausting) process of paring down the list of submissions and creating the program. Reviewers get a window into how the Planning Committee works and gain a sense of transparency and agency in their relationship with the Symposium through this opportunity. For the Planning Committee, we benefit from these additional perspectives and voices as we make decisions toward final implementation of the program.

##### Multilingualism

The pandemic prompted a major shift for the Symposium in many ways. After recovering from our lightspeed pivot to Zoom in March 2020, the planning committee investigated what opportunities an all-virtual conference could provide. Up to that point, the conference had always been exclusively in English. Given the value we place on building a global community, this was a significant limitation. However, with a conference entirely on Zoom, we could leverage the platform’s interpretation features and put funds freed up from travel and catering expenses towards hiring interpreters.

At the time, there were few conferences that were conducted in multiple languages. DH2020 in Ottawa was intended to be multilingual but had been canceled due to the pandemic. We reached out to our DH community and our local community at MSU with the goal of finding collaborators. We strove to find people we could learn from so that we could support our interpreters in their work while staying within our budget. We connected with Melissa Jameson, a professional Spanish-English interpreter who was instrumental in guiding us through the process of building multilingual infrastructure. She helped us understand the norms and best practices of the field and gave us a roadmap for how to support our other interpreters.

Since then, each year the planning committee has reflected and iterated the (often imperfect) ways we support multilingualism at the Symposium. Since the first year, we have supported interpretation between Spanish and English. For the first two years of our multilingual endeavor, we also supported French-English interpretation with an eye towards supporting scholars on the African continent. However, over the course of those two years, we received very few proposals in French and little indication that participants were tuning into the French language channel in Zoom. It became clear that French wasn’t expanding our reach in the ways we had hoped. In 2022, we decided to experiment with supporting Mandarin Chinese after hearing that the Symposium was promoted on WeChat in Chinese-speaking DH circles. However, Chinese proved to be a more challenging language to build infrastructure for. We had fewer connections to speakers in that community and relied on relative newcomers to the field. While we were happy to provide opportunities for new interpreters to gain valuable experience, our small team needed to put in too much labor for the quality of translation, especially considering the low demand for it that we were seeing. We made the difficult decision to make the 2024 Symposium bilingual in Spanish and English only, with the plan of deepening our engagement with Spanish-language DH communities.

##### Running the Event 

As a one-of-its-kind DH symposium, we are committed to planting and growing the seeds of transformative, emerging, and nascent Global DH work in the world. To that end, our presentations are all plenary -- not only does this allow for greater visibility and equity, making the sessions plenary also means increased engagement and collegiality. When the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a shift to a virtual event, we also provided human-created captioning.

The Symposium has always – and will always – offer free registration. For in-person days (the Symposium was entirely in-person from 2016-2019 and has returned to offering an in-person day since 2023), we take seriously the role that hospitality, space, and tone play in building community during a conference, so we work to offer low-cost to no-cost accommodation, provide delicious food to suit all dietary needs, and build comfortable spaces for conference discussion. The in-person event has also always been live-streamed, so that the work of presenters can be shared more widely. The Global DH Symposium, therefore, functions as a global and local event, with a priority on an ethics of welcome and openness as our guiding principle.

Conference presentation is a valuable component of scholarly activity, but it can be ephemeral. For this reason, the Symposium provides infrastructure for presenters to contribute their work to a more persistent scholarly record. Since the first Symposium in 2016, we have shared recordings of presentations that were live-streamed with the aim that those artifacts serve to amplify the work of the scholars and support their continued life in the field. In 2021, we launched proceedings on Humanities Commons, using its features as a public website and a subject repository to encourage discovery. In November and December 2023, we released a double special issue of Reviews in Digital Humanities to showcase 8 projects that were part of the 2023 Symposium, and we anticipate future collaborations with the Reviews in DH journal.

In celebration of the 10th Symposium in 2025, we will launch a Global Digital Humanities journal as a publication venue for global DH work writ large. This journal will be an open and inclusive space, offering translation across languages and across cultural contexts (Ortega 2019), and opening possibilities for scholarly visibility and reward.

####   
Conclusion

In keeping with the meaning of symposium (a lively gathering for conversation, drinking, and intellectual discussion), we are deliberate about creating a joyful, affirmative, and generative space for sharing ideas, projects, and knowledge, for this is also what our ongoing work as a global DH team committed to social justice means. A community, a digital humanities project, a pedagogical resource, and a global event -- this is the ever-growing, ever-evolving Global Digital Humanities Symposium.
