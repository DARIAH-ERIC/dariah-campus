summary:
  content: In this presentation we learn about how a computer game company
    collaborated with a national museum to produce a computer game about the
    Icelandic Viking past with a focus on women. The game, and collaboration,
    centers around a single key object in the museum holding. The presentation
    also discusses plans to develop a virtual museum within the game, to display
    other objects from the museum for gamers to engage with.

A short overview of the journey of an item from 1400-1600 being found in the 19th century, ending up in the National Museum of Iceland. Where it became a part of the museum's main exhibition for 20 years. In 2023 the item was 3D scanned and gained a new life and purpose within the computer game Island of Winds. In the game there will also be a museum where the item will be on display. But is there a difference between the corporeal museum and the digital one?
