In this resource, the second video resource in the **ARTEMIS project** learning series, Federica Maietti (University of Ferrara) introduces the relevance of heritage digitisation in relation to risk management and prevention in simulation, restauration, and conservation processes. She provides background knowledge in applying digital tools for cultural heritage. First, she will highlight the risks and issues that currently affect cultural heritage, followed by discussing the most important guidelines and reference documents and policies surrounding heritage risk management and best pracitices. Second, she will address the needs that digital technologies must meet and showcase what ARTEMIS has to offer in terms of monitoring, managing, simulating and evaluating heritage at risk through the **Reactive Heritage Digital Twin (RHDT)** **framework**.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

* Frame the issues of heritage at risk in relation to scenarios of innovation in digitalisation
* Be familiar with the main reference documents, guidelines, reports, and policies related to heritage at risk, by European Commission, UNESCO, ICOMOS
* Understand the main research needs and directions focused on heritage at risk and digital innovation
* Discover the main ARTEMIS capabilities for preventive conservation of heritage at risk
