Gagarin Interactive has developed XR experiences for several cultural heritage projects in Iceland. Two specific outdoors sites, Thingvellir and Hofsstaðir in Garðabær, where visitors can look into the past are highlighted in this talk. Each site has a different approach for technology used to create the XR experiences.  This presentation demonstrates how specific XR technologies have been developed and used at different outdoor cultural heritage sites in Iceland and reflects on how technologies can be adapted to specific circumstances.

Developed within the INTERREG NPA funded project DACCHE: [https://linktr.ee/dacche\_interreg](https://linktr.ee/dacche_interreg)
