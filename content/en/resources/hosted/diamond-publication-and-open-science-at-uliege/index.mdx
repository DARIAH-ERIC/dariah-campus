This presentation will trace the evolution of Open Science at the University of Liège in the early 2000s, focusing on Open Access and the implementation of a Diamant Open Access journal publishing platform (PoPuPS) and an institutional repository (ORBi).  The concept has evolved over time to take into account other principles of Open Science, culminating with the publication of an Open Science roadmap for the University of Liège.  This presentation will explain how our concerns fit into the European framework, and the role of the library in driving developments and progress.

This webinar was delivered in March 2024 as part of the DARIAH 'Friday Frontiers' webinar series
