    This resource explores how a digital twin can represent, connect, and reason
    about entities of the real world through structured knowledge. It defines a
    semantically grounded approach to knowledge integration, management, and
    reasoning in the Cultural Heritage domain.

In this resource, the first video resource on the **Digital Twin** and **Reactive Heritage Digital Twin (RHDT)** **Concept**. Achille Felicetti (ARIADNE RI) introduces the conceptual foundations of the RHDT model and illustrates the role of its ontological structure in building a coherent and interoperable semantic-enabled knowledge base for heritage assets. He illustrates the key principles of semantic modelling and explains how ontologies, particularly those derived from the CIDOC CRM family, enable the representation of complex relationships between objects, processes, and digital services. This resource also illustrates how RHDT applies these principles to create a reactive, knowledge-driven digital environment, where data from monitoring, analysis, and simulation are integrated and contextualised within a unified semantic view. Finally, the session underlines how ontological reasoning can assist preventive conservation, risk evaluation, and adaptive management of cultural entities.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

* understand what a Heritage Digital Twin is, and how it differs from static 3D models by incorporating historical information and data about life cycle and dynamic interactions with real-world cultural objects.
* comprehend how intangible aspects, such as historical memory, documentation, and cultural significance, are integrated into the digital twin to mirror the true identity of cultural entities.
* gain an overview of the fundamental role of ontologies, specifically the CIDOC CRM ecosystem, in formally representing complex cultural knowledge and ensuring data interoperability.&#x20;
* grasp how ontologies can be used to implement semantic knowledge bases that serve as the engine powering Heritage Digital Twins."
