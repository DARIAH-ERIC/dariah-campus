summary:
  content: Agiatis Benardou began her academic career with degrees in ancient
    history, and her first employment was in cultural organisations. She met and
    was hired by a scholar who introduced her to digitisation projects and as a
    result she was exposed to the 'digital world'. Dr Bernardou became involved
    in preparing DARIAH as a project, and her experience in digitisation was
    useful in her professional transition into work in a research
    infrastructure. She argues that research infrastructures are all about
    people. They should focus on inspiring researchers theoretically, and also
    practically by exposing them to the most state-of-the-art tools and
    techniques.

Agiatis Benardou began her academic career with degrees in ancient history, and her first employment was in cultural organisations. She met and was hired by a scholar who introduced her to digitisation projects and as a result she was exposed to the 'digital world'. Dr Bernardou became involved in preparing DARIAH as a project, and her experience in digitisation was useful in her professional transition into work in a research infrastructure. She argues that research infrastructures are all about people. They should focus on inspiring researchers theoretically, and also practically by exposing them to the most state-of-the-art tools and techniques.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
