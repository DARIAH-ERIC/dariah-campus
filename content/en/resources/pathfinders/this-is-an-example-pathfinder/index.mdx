The ‘Pathfinder’ resource on DARIAH-Campus offers a slightly different approach to sharing knowledge and training materials.  They serve in many ways as a ‘state of the art’ / ‘literature review’ for a subject, but with a focus specifically on training materials.  As a result, the actual format of a Pathfinder can vary.  But for the most part, they offer an introduction to the overall theme, and then go on to discuss training resources around that theme before summarising the main points in a conclusion. &#x20;

You should first start with an overall introduction to the pathfinder resource itself, outlining the overall structure.  This will then be followed by some learning outcomes. &#x20;

## Learning Outcomes

After reading through this Pathfinder, learners will be able to:

* Understand the style guide required for a Pathfinder Resource
* Make use of the widgets available in the CMS
* Draft up their own Pathfinder resource

## Introduction to Pathfinders

The structure of a Pathfinder resource can vary, so instead we will demonstrate some of the features you might want to include.  At the same time, while demonstrating a how you might want to introduce different training materials on a topic, you will find below other Pathfinder resources that have been published to give you an idea of how you might want to proceed with your own resource.

### Examples of Pathfinders

You can take a look at the following Pathfinders to see how they have approached their topics and introduced the different sources that they discuss.

The '<Link link={{"discriminant":"resources-pathfinders","value":"why-space-is-special-an-intro-to-gis-and-geospatial-history"}}>**A Basic Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**</Link>' pathfinder resource looked specifically at different training and learning materials available to introduce learners to spatial humanities and the tools that can be used when conducting analysis of data with a spatial element.

The '<Link link={{"discriminant":"resources-pathfinders","value":"elexis-pathfinder-to-computional-lexicography-for-developers-and-computational-linguists"}}>**ELEXIS Pathfinder to Computational Lexicography for Developers and Computational Linguists**</Link>**'** provides software developers and computational linguists with an overview of the typical computational processing tasks and software tools in the lexicographic workflow.

The '<Link link={{"discriminant":"resources-pathfinders","value":"dariah-pathfinder-to-data-management-best-practices-in-the-humanities"}}>**DARIAH Pathfinder to Data Management Best Practices in the Humanities**</Link>**'** was one of the first Pathfinder resources to be published, and investigates best practices in the relationship between Open Science and Digital Humanities.
