The first part of the event covers the basic concepts of network analysis, including:\
what a network (graph) is, network nodes and edges, network centralities, structural properties of networks, and their interpretation in a humanities research context.\
It also provides examples of literary networks based on dramatic texts from various European literatures (German, English, Russian).

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

* Acquire basic skills in network analysis, including an understanding of key concepts (network nodes, network edges) and metrics (network centralities, network density, clustering properties).\

* Compare networks based on their structural properties (e.g. network density, clustering coefficient) and compare individual nodes based on different centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector, closeness).
