The second part of the event focuses on the technical aspects of data preparation for network analysis and addresses the following questions:

* How are networks stored in a machine-readable form?
* How can research objects be represented as networks?
* Is it possible to automate network extraction?

Furthermore, this learning resource demonstrates how to encode networks with EzLinaViz an online tool that generates CSV files with network data from simple segmentations of dramatic texts.

After completing this resource, learners will be able to:

* Recognise when it is (or is not) appropriate to operationalise a research object as a network.
* Understand different data formats used for network analysis.
* Construct simple networks from textual data.
