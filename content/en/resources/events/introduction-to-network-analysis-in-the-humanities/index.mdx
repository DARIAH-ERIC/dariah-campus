summary:
  title: Introduction to Network Analysis in the Humanities
  content: >-
    This online workshop is organised within the framework of the Computational
    Literary Studies Infrastructure (CLS INFRA) project. The event introduces
    the fundamentals of network analysis for humanities scholars, combining
    historical and literary case studies with hands-on practice. Participants
    will explore networks of literary characters, letter correspondence, and
    historical actors, and learn to visualise and interpret these structures
    using accessible tools like Gephi and EzLinaVis.
