Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to datasets that are publicly available, can be linked to other datasets, and can be interpreted and used not only by humans but also by machines. This presentation outlines the main principles of LOD and its underlying framework, the Semantic Web. Technical aspects are also covered, including how to formalise LOD using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), ontologies, and controlled vocabularies; how to express it using a human-readable syntax (Turtle); and how to search through it using the SPARQL query language.
