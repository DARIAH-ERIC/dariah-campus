Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to a method of ”publishing structured data on the Web” [1](/cls-infra/ts-vienna-2024/-/wikis/1)([https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkedData)) so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. The concept builds on the principles of the Semantic Web, where data is given meaningful links that allow it to be connected across different domains and platforms. LOD consists of open datasets that are published in a machine-readable format, allowing computers to easily discover and process the data.

This presentation gives a very short introduction to the basic concepts of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data (LOD).
