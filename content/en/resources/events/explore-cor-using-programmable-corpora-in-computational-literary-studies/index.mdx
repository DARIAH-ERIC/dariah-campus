    This three-day training school organised by the CLS Infra project focused on
    dynamic collections of literary texts manipulated programmatically. 
    Learners will learn to find, evaluate, and select corpora using tools like
    CLSCor and DraCor, and gain skills in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, API
    querying, Linked Open Data, and Digital Literary Network Analysis. The
    training addresses reproducibility using Docker, promoting transparent,
    replicable research in Computational Literary Studies.

## About the Training School&#x20;

&#x20; The academic training school, "ExploreCor: Using Programmable Corpora in Computational Literary Studies," took place in Vienna in June 2024, spanning three intensive days. The unique programme was designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the research cycle in Computational Literary Studies, equipping them with the skills needed to navigate the evolving landscape of digital humanities.

&#x20; The training school began by delving into the critical process of finding and evaluating corpora of literary texts. Participants explored the concept of Programmable Corpora, a pivotal aspect of the curriculum. Programmable Corpora are dynamic collections of literary works that can be manipulated programmatically, allowing for customised and nuanced analyses.

&#x20; The curriculum progressed to the formulation of research questions and the subsequent execution of analyses using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Attendees utilised the tool DraCor, designed for efficient and flexible literary text analysis. Additionally, the training incorporated the clsCor catalogue, a Linked Data-powered resource developed within the CLS INFRA project, enabling students to explore and select corpora for their research.

&#x20; An integral component of the training focused on APIs and Linked Data, emphasising the interconnected nature of literary datasets. Students engaged in exemplary research projects using the DraCor system, gaining hands-on experience in navigating digital literary networks. The training school addressed the issue of Repeatable Research, a challenge in the Digital Humanities landscape, and explored methods to ensure research replicability.

&#x20; Digital Literary Network Analysis is a key topic covered in the programme, providing participants with the tools to uncover intricate relationships within literary texts. A dedicated segment addressed the Reproducibility Crisis in Digital Humanities, underscoring the importance of transparent and replicable research practices.

&#x20; To ensure the longevity and accessibility of research outcomes, the training school introduced Docker as a valuable tool. Participants learnt how to leverage Docker to encapsulate their research environments, enhancing the reproducibility of their findings.

&#x20; By combining theoretical foundations with practical applications, participants left equipped to navigate the complexities of programmable corpora, digital literary analysis, and reproducible research, contributing to the ongoing advancement of the field.
