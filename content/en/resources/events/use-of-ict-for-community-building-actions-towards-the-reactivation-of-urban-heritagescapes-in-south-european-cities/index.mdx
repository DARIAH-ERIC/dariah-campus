## Workshop Abstract

Challenged by urbanization, economy, gentrification, migration, and climate change the experience of historical spaces and buildings is fragmented, thus mirroring the disconnected perception of urban societies. This Dariah workshop studied how urban heritage and the abundance of culturally valuable structures in historic cities across Europe can contribute to reflective processes and the creation of legible, inclusive, accessible, resilient and enjoyable cities.

The workshop aimed to offer to authorities and policy makers of the city opportunities for data-driven consultation actions that engage:

- Cultural Heritage institutions;
- Scholars and researchers in Digital Humanities;
- City stakeholders;
- Professional associations;
- Urban communities and citizen groups
