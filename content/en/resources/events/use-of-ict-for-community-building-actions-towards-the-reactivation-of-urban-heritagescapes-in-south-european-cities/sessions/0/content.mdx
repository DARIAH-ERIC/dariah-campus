### Learning Objectives

***Participatory Design:*** Learn how community-building projects can engage local stakeholders, pull insights from diverse perspectives, and influence urban redevelopment authorities.

***Urban Theory:*** Hear state-of-the-art theories and approaches to sustainable heritage, with reflections from experienced architects, academics, and urban thinkers. Identify critical issues of urban gentrification, place-making, and the pressures faced by historic urban neighbourhoods in Southern Europe.

***Information-Communication Technology:*** See state-of-the-art technologies deployed for rapid 3D reconstruction, documentation, and urban co-design with non-experts. We specifically explore augmented reality as a possible solution to scalable public outreach.
