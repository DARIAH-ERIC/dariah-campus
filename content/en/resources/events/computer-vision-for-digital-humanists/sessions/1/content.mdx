Anguelos Nicolaou leads the rest of this module, beginning with the session 'Taxonomy of Methods'. Computer vision is not just a one-size-fits-all analysis. There are multiple distinct methods or subtasks, such as classification, image segmentation, and many more that you will need to know about so you know what your problem is called and what methods are best to tackle it. Nikolaou then discusses 'Performance Evaluation and Epistemology'. This segment focuses on how to evaluate the effectiveness of computer vision algorithms. It also delves into the nuances of algorithmic learning, highlighting potential pitfalls such as algorithms finding spurious patterns or taking unintended shortcuts. It stresses the importance of using evaluation techniques to ensure the validity of computer vision models, fostering critical engagement with the outputs of computer vision algorithms.
