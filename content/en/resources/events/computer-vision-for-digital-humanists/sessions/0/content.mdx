This Winter School module introduces digital humanists to computer vision, combining the theoretical background with practical skills. It is tailored for those new to computer vision, offering a broad understanding of basic concepts to Digital Humanities applications.

The first module presents a basic introduction to machine learning, offering the necessary theoretical background for understanding computer vision. This is complemented by a historical review of Computer Vision, outlining its evolution and key developments.

The video school places a strong emphasis on practical skills, such as creating one's own custom deep-learning models for computer vision using Python. Participants will engage in several sessions focused on data preparation, including selection, preprocessing, and organization, as well as model construction and optimization with tools like TensorBoard. The school also includes a session on no-code computer vision tools, providing alternatives for participants who prefer not to code their own models from scratch. Basic knowledge of Python is expected as a prerequisite to the practicals but not necessary for the tools session.

An important component of the school is exploring computer vision applications in Digital Humanities, including a literature review and the current state of the field. A discussion on a collaborative project between a computer scientist and a humanities scholar illustrates the challenges and benefits of interdisciplinary work in the Digital Humanities.

Overall, this school aims to equip digital humanists with the knowledge and skills to incorporate computer vision techniques into their research, balancing theoretical background with hands-on practice.
