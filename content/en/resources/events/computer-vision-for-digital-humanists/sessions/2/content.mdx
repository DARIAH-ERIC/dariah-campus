Niklas Tscherne begins the module by introducing Tropy, a software
designed for managing research photographs. Tropy is particularly useful
for organizing large collections of visual data and supplementing them
with their associated metadata.

Following Tscherne, Germaine GÃ¶tzelmann presents a variety of out-of-the-box computer vision tools suitable for Humanities research. She covers topics such as mathematical morphology and introduces tools like LAREX or VISE from the Oxford Visual Geometry Group. Her examples contain detecting images or illustrations in early modern books. Her presentation demonstrates that a number of computer vision tasks in the Humanities can be done without relying on deep learning. Although this is clearly the dominant paradigm nowadays and will probably continue to be even more dominant in the future.
