The final session of the schools provides an overview of computer vision applications in the digital humanities in the context of the Distant Viewing paradigm.

The first video, by Sarah Lang and Suzana Sagadin, offers an extensive literature review on the application of computer vision in digital humanities. It revisits essential concepts from the initial machine learning introduction, connecting these technical ideas to their practical use in (Digital) Humanities research. It also addresses ethical considerations when with computational methods in the context of cultural heritage data.

The second video follows an interdisciplinary discussion between a humanities scholar and a computer scientist from the ERC DiDip (From Digital to Distant Diplomatics) project ([https://didip.hypotheses.org/](https://didip.hypotheses.org/)). This conversation sheds light on the challenges and learning opportunities in interdisciplinary collaboration, demonstrating how computational methods can complement humanities research and showing what such collaboration can look like in practice.
