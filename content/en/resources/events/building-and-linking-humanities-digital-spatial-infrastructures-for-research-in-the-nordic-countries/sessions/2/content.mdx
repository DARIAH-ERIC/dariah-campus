Ruth Mostern outlines humanities perspectives on place and place-making and how these can be operationalised in SRIs. The collaborative World Historical Gazetteer (WHG) project and its outputs serve as the main example. The talk focuses primarily on developing ontologies and vocabulary in a project setting e.g. Linked Places Format developed for the WHG.
