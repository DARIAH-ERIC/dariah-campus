summary:
  title: Building and Linking Humanities' Digital Spatial Infrastructures
  content: This workshop, focussing on "Spatial data medieval to modern", is the
    first of a series of workshops from the NOS-HS project "Linking, Building,
    and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial Infrastructures for Research in
    the Nordic Countries".  The main aims of this workshop were to define key
    concepts (spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data, metadata, ontology),
    outline major challenges in the field, and to provide an opportunity to
    share experiences of addressing the issues in individual and national
    projects across the Nordic countries.

This workshop covers key concepts in the field of (spatial) digital research infrastructures in the Humanities such as spatial infrastructures, Linked Open Data (LOD), metadata, ontology etc. It also outlines major challenges in the field and gives some concrete, authentic examples of how to overcome them in small and large-scale projects in both academia and the GLAM sector.

The project **"Linking, Building and Sustaining Humanities Digital Spatial
Infrastructures for Research in the Nordic Countries"** aims to bring together
humanities researchers and research engineers and others in related sectors
(museums, archives, libraries) who are working on geocoded humanities data
pertaining to the Nordic countries and beyond. The objectives are to:

(1) generate dialogue and exchange between relevant academic and non-academic
sectors on the subject of spatial data and data infrastructures in the
Humanities, and

(2) facilitate a collaborative initiative whereby common principles regarding ontologies and metadata will be mapped out by members of
the network.

Collaborative data infrastructure solutions based on Linked Open
Data (LOD) and FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
Reusable) will underpin and further advance Humanities research that
builds on geocoded data.

The project is a new Nordic co-operation creating a network with a shared vision regarding geocoded humanities data and sustainability needs.  In addition, the project positions Nordic participants and spatial data at the heart of a working group that aims to submit a European grant application under the Research Infrastructures call in the Horizon Europe Program for 2021-2027. Concrete results from the collaboration will be published in the form of reports and scientific papers.

In this first workshop, three issues were addressed:

(1) establishing common metadata
principles and ontologies in Nordic Humanities digital spatial infrastructure
for research;

(2) implementation of Linked Open Data principles to existing
datasets curated by workshop organizers;

(3) work towards an EU grant application.

Keynote speakers and invited participants shared theoretical and practical experiences.
