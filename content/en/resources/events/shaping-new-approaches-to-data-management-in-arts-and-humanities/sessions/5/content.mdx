## Abstract

In this workshop we will underline the importance and the role that data management plans play in good data management. A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that specifies how research data will be handled both during and after a research project, describing what data will be collected / generated, the methodology and standards followed, whether and how this data will be shared and/or made open, and how it will be curated and preserved. DMPs are living documents, updated when needed throughout the research process. More and more research funders require a DMP as a deliverable, but there are several reasons why DMPs are part of good research practices.Learning objectives:- Understand the importance of research data management;
- Discover how a Data Management Plan (DMP) can help you be more efficient in your research;
- Be aware of the European Comission's requirements on research data;
- Be able to start your own research data management plan.In the second part of the workshop the participants will get to know tools and will start their own data management plan.
