## Abstract

This session aims to approach challenges and innovative models related to multilingualism within bibliodiversity in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). The role of language in research practices tends to be considered secondary in STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), as there seems to be a tacit assumption that English is widely accepted as the language of communication. English tends to be promoted in (inter)national and European research and innovation policies – mainly written in English and with scarce reference to language use or multilingualism. In this context, SSH specific needs regarding scholarly communication in native languages has to be addressed: in those disciplines where language and concepts are very often not only means of communication but objects of research themselves, the use of mother tongue is indispensable for in-depth understanding, and knowledge co-creation and sharing. In this setting, the challenge of multilingualism should sit alongside the concept of 'bibliodiversity', coined by the International Alliance of Independent Publishers, which refers to "cultural diversity applied to the world of books"; that is, underlining the need to encompass a diversity of languages, scientific areas, publication formats, and actors. There are firm grounds to state that bibliodiversity, through multilingual publishing, is an efficient way of protecting national languages and enhancing different academic rhetorical traditions, by reaching specialists and wider audiences in a complementary way. Therefore, it is of the utmost relevance to understand how bibliodiversity, in its manifold formats and multilingual forms, is promoted through innovative practices and high-level programmatic involvement. In order to illustrate this, a presentation will be made of the OPERAS consortium at large, as well as of the more particular scope of the recently EU funded project TRIPLE. Finally, a practical approach will be made taking as reference the UC Digitalis ecosystem, based on the experience of Coimbra University Press.
