## Abstract

*Keynote*

Where do our commitments lie in safeguarding our collective cultural memory? How does the overwhelming and unstoppable digital revolution change our social, cultural and scholarly life and how does it lead us to rethink and reshape our priorities? In her keynote speech, Prof. Fernanda Rollo shows us how the global societal challenges and sustainable development goals of our age shape data challenges and responsibilities within the Digital Humanities. She defines 7 key areas that will directly influence new approaches to data management in the arts and humanities:- Awareness and training
- Digital heritage
- The frightening and overwhelming loss of digital heritage
- Preservation of digital heritage
- Organization of digital heritage
- Collaborative work
- A cultural changeThe second half of the talk outlines how pillars of the Open Science paradigm (such as Citizen Science, training and advocacy, Open Access publishing models, infrastructures, new research metrics) are instrumental in tackling these issues.
