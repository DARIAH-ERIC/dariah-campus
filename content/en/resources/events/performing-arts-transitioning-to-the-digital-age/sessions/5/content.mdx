Since the first notion of the synergy between computer music and theatre in the 1980s, the potential of complementing these practices with each other has significantly grown along the steep trajectories of technical advancements and the influence of new media, generative art, and resulting aesthetics. In comparison to traditional musical forms, computer music allows previously unreachable levels of automation, control, interaction, and sonic diversity. Techniques like algorithmic composition (using formal rules to create music), data sonification (translating data into sound), live coding (writing computer code that generates music live in front of the audience), automation in multimediality, and various aspects of interactivity open novel opportunities in the context of theatre. This presentation gives a brief overview of predominant practices and trends in computer music with examples of their application to performing arts.
