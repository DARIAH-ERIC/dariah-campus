The talk provides an introductory exploration of current PhD research being conducted into the information-seeking behaviours of dance researchers as well as the practice of dance archivists, to inform any future developments of online dance archives resources. This talk encompasses a UK-centric exploration of dance archives, dance archive professionals, and dance researchers, along with a careful outline of the methodological approach adopted within the project. The talk also explores the challenges faced in bringing both UK dance researchers and dance archivists together during a global pandemic, whilst providing a commentary on the impact the research could have on the transition to a digital future for dance archives.
