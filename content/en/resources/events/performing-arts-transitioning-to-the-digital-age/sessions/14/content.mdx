In what form will performance art, a discipline that once strived to be present and ephemeral at the same time, survive the transfer into the digital? This lecture is a form of warning that tries to balance alarmist technophobia and radical instances of digital humanism. By using anti-humanist thought and (non)concepts the artist tries to reconcile his fears and his work into the new archival dynamic that is yet to come. Calling into question the remains, traces and spectres of immanence and ephemerality in performance art, the artist opens his own fears and wounds of time. Using his own artistic experience in durational performances, theoretical knowledge and some elements of lecture performance, the artist presents the fuzzy and indeterminate materiality of performance art as a means of survival within the digital.
