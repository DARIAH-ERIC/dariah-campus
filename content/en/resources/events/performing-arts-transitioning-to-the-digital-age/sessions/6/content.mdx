The aim of the project was to create a virtual encyclopaedic source of theatrical knowledge using Linked (Open) Data in order to include it in a wider network of cultural sources that provide theatrical information, within the framework of the Semantic Web. Using the Digitized Archive of the National Theatre of Greece as the reference archive, I tried enriching it through its semantic interconnections with digital sources that provide relevant knowledge. Some of the most notable existing theatre archives and databases have been researched as well as the users' informative demands influenced by the types of information that appear in each archive, such as biographies, productions, texts, and interviews. This talk introduces a conceptual model designed to be as adequate as possible to represent theatrical archives and to cover a sufficient range of offered theatrical information. The FRBR model was harmonised with the global CIDOC CRM cultural documentation standard to produce the FRBRoo object-oriented library ontology, with which the final model is partially compatible.
