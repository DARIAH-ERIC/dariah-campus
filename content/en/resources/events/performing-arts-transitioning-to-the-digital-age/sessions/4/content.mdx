In the framework of the DARIAH-EU WG Theatralia compilation project of the International Theatrical Registry, I launched the RADATMAS project at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" in February 2022. This is a randomized research study of the little town of Macerata and its surrounding area. Thanks to the RADATMAS census thirty-one theatre archives have been discovered, while in the Ministry of Italian Culture (MIC) SIUSA database there are only three archives. The same goes for the theatres: the census found forty-one theatres out of the twenty-three reported by the MIC. The census of theatres and theatrical archives located in the Macerata area as well as the organization of the collected data was completed in the summer of 2022. In September, a colleague from the AI Department joined the working group to jointly design the database of the Italian Theatres and Archives Registry.
