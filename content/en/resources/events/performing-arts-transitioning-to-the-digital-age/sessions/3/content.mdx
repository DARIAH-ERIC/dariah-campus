Eurokaz was a festival of new theatre that was founded in Zagreb in 1987 and took place until 2013 when it was transformed into a producing house that is still active today. Thanks to a grant from the Kultura Nova Foundation the process of digitization of the festival archive has begun last year. It is a big challenge and we have encountered many problems due to a wide time span which amounts to 27 years of the festival's existence. During this period archiving technology was constantly changing and what we have today is a lot of material in different formats the content of which has to be adjusted to new standards. From press cuttings in paper form to CDs and DVDs and old websites for each year's program which are not supported anymore (like with Adobe Flash Player), not to mention old video tapes with recorded performances. It is a hefty workload and we assigned an IT expert to create a separate segment on the Eurokaz website, where our archive will be visible to a wider audience.
