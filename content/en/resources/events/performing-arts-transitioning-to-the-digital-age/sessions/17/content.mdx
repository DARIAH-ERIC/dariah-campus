Performers of extreme music theatre intensify agencements in configuration with different models of Schachtophones and media body effects. This electronicized voluptas is part of a lecture performance by DB Indoš and Tanja Vrvilo on the iconoclash of the remediation of live performance material for different dispositifs and the reproduction of the sources of performing presence in the dictatorship of telematics. What is left behind in a performer's absence? Extreme Schachtophone Parainstitute Indoš is the working title of the site-specific project that we are currently working on – the interior Schacthophonic panzerism of two connected spaces of the Parainstitute Indoš into an interactive machinic display for collective rhizomatic work with Schacthophones' databases, from the activation of built-in instruments, reconstructions and re-enactments of audio and video archives, collection of scores and texts, stage and sound sketches to the new politics of schachtophonisation of the community.
