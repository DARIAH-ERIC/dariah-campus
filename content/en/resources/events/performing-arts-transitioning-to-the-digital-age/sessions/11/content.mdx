The Elementary School for Classical Ballet and Contemporary Dance at OŠ Vežica presented the world premiere of the dance-film fairy tale The Journey of Halima at Art-Kino, Rijeka on 11 February 2023. It was directed by Kate Foley, with visual effects and editing by Damjan Šporčić. It was filmed with 110 young dancers, six adults and eight choreographers during the pandemic in 2021. The original score by Zoran Majstorović features the musical traditions and instruments of the contemporary migrant trail from Mesopotamia to Northern Europe. The Journey of Halima is based on the children's book of the same name by Nikos Kalaitzidis with Michalis Darnakis, Maria Laftsidou, and Andreas Mavridis, written to empower refugee children. This hybrid form of dance documentation marked a triumph over a difficult period of compromise in which dance education suffered from poor digital tools and inadequate space, 19 where Viber and Microsoft Teams clashed with poor reception in cramped hallways, bedrooms and kitchens. It also delivers this theatrical effort in a more durable and shareable form than the original stage production could have ever accomplished.
