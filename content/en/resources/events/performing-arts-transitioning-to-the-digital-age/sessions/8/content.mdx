Responding to challenges and turning crises into new opportunities have become the leading features of CCA Dakh / FCA GogolFest. Laboratory of Solutions in Digital, created at the beginning of the global Covid pandemic, began as simple attempts to combine theatre and digital reality in Zoom. Then, the team managed to create digital repertoires and become an example of digital theatre in Ukraine. Streaming ready-made performances and installations, implementing digital technologies in performances, and international online collaborations became the ways to survive when the theatre was impossible to visit and, consequently, became a development strategy. The theatre is becoming an intersection of different industries, science, literature, visual arts, education, and a voice of social challenges. In the reality of Ukraine, digital theatre is also becoming an important cultural element of the struggle.
