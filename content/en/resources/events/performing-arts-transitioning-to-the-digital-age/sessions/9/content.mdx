Departing from traditional archives based on the analysis of material artefacts as the only credible sources in reconstructing past events and the characterization of a dance performance that “becomes through disappearance”, bodily archives follow the idea that a dance performance does leave a trace, only leaves it differently: relying on perceptive and receptive mechanisms observers, interpreters, participants in the performance. Reliance on recollection and bodily tools such as observation, memorization, and evocation in the reconstruction of events are just as reliable or just as unreliable as reliance on archived material remains, because the material remains do not tell about what was excluded from the archive and why it was excluded, and are always in the service of construction, which implies an interpretation, a narrative, and not reconstruction of real events.
