Costume as an installation, costume as a performance, costume as the main protagonist in a digital environment – these are my artistic interests as a visual artist and costume designer. My presentation, therefore, is based on the overview of my artistic work in the field of costume design across various media, discourses, and contexts, advanced over the past twelve years as the result of merging ideas and experiences from different artistic fields, and of striving to overcome and expand the traditional approaches in costume design and drama theatre. The presentation is illustrated by a selection of my costume designs and projects created beyond the boundaries of mainstream theatre stages and productions, but the central part is dedicated to my most recent work, the series of video performances developed during the Covid pandemic and united under the joint title "Ivana Bakal – The Visual Theatre", part one and two.
