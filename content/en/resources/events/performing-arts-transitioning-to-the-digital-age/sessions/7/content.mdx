As the holders of information about various entities in the performing arts sector, industry associations, unions and national institutions have a pivotal role to play in the data-centric performing arts sector. Since 2020, the Canadian Association for the Performing Arts has supported more than 20 such “arts service organizations” in the implementation of best practices for data management and data sharing. As a result, information about 7,500 performers, designers, organizations and venues has been transformed from unstructured text into linked open data. This open data was then made available for reuse via an open knowledge graph called Artsdata and via Wikidata, an open knowledge base associated with the Wikimedia movement. This data-centric work has laid a foundation of data for reuse across performing arts archives and other performing arts applications. Although this information is not yet being used in performing arts archives, CAPACOA proved this concept with its LIVE Performing Arts Directory, a directory entirely populated by open data.
