This conference talk aims to outline the most important issues of the relations between theatre and performance studies and digital phenomena. Its primary goal is to give an overview of the possibilities that digital humanities can offer to theatre and performance studies. It also raises questions and depicts problems that this kind of approach implies, and it as well tries to offer tentative conclusions about the benefits that the encounter between theatre and performance studies on one hand and digital humanities on the other brings. Consequently, the goal is not to come to an obligatory conclusion, but rather to ask questions and provoke discussions that could help contribute to future studies.
