The research projects in digital humanities and digital theatre studies "L'École du Spectateur" and "Visual Staging", jointly led by La Rochelle Université, Université de Lille and Université de Poitiers, work in collaboration with cognitive sciences and neurosciences in order to define and/or analyse a number of characteristics of the performing arts that the traditional research methods have not been able to detect or measure, such as the importance of the venue where the performance takes place, the relevance of the joint presence of the audience and the artist during a live show or the involvement of the emotions felt by the spectator in the appreciation of a performance.
