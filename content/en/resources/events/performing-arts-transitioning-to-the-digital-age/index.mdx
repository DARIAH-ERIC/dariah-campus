The transition process of cultural and artistic institutions, associations and individual artists to digital communication, which has been going on for several decades, has recently been further accelerated by various factors such as the pandemic or digital transformations of state institutions. Digital communication in the field of art, in addition to everyday, professional and administrative communication, which also includes promotional activities, encompasses shaping and presenting artistic work with the help of digital technologies and, afterward, digital processing and storage of administrative and archival material.

Performing arts, which are considered intangible cultural heritage, are particularly difficult to adapt to this situation precisely because their value is largely manifested as the totality of all tangible elements (scenography, costume design, dramatic text, lighting, etc.), which at a specific moment in conjunction with the audience create a unique and intangible experience and expression. Extensive use of digital technology and communication platforms for theatrical performance implies a radical change in the communication code and requires a major adaptation of previously acquired and established knowledge. It also requires the acquisition of new knowledge, which is often not closely related to the arts and humanities.

The conference aimed to examine the possibilities of interdisciplinary connecting information sciences and computer science with the performing arts in the context of digital humanities while reflecting on the achievements so far on this path. Therefore, through three thematic blocks it was shown, among other things, how digital humanities tools can serve scholars in performing arts research, what is the relationship between digital technologies and theatrical performance and, finally, what are the possibilities of digital archiving and linking data on performing arts material on both national and international level. At the same time, the conference introduced members of the national theatre community, i.e. performing arts and theatre (i.e. performance) studies with leading international scholars and experts in the field.
