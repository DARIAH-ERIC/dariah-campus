This is an introductory overview of the field of stylometry and multivariate text analysis. We discuss classic approaches to text representation, such as bag of words, and show the ability of word frequencies to reflect meaningful cultural and social conditions of texts: genre, chronology and authorship.

## R and RStudio

The most important thing to do would be installing R and RStudio on your machine. We will use the stylo library for most of the day; if you want, you can look at step-by-step introduction to stylo for beginners, or at the more extensive HOW TO, but we will cover all the basics.
NB. In case you don't / can't install R and stylo locally, there will be an option to run analysis from Colab, just be aware it will require more coding, not less coding, because of the stylo's interface that doesn't work in Colab.
You are free to bring your own collection of texts to the workshop, but you also can find plain text fiction collections in various languages on the Computational Stylistics website.

## Materials

We will use GDrive folder that holds all necessary materials.
Your options are:

* Download it and work locally
* Download -> re-upload folder to work in Colabs' virtual machine with R (or just open the .ipynb notebook, then File -> Save a copy in Drive. It will create a copy of the notebook on your own Drive.)

To copy folder to your own GDrive, do this:

* Download CLS\_Madrid\_Folder
* Extract the downloaded .zip
* Upload the extracted folder back to your GDrive
