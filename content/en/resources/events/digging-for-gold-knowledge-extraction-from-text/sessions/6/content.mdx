This session introduces the 'stylo' library for R that allows to perform different stylometric analysis on a collection of documents. We quickly introduce R language and go over a graphical user interface of 'stylo' to show practicalities of feature selection, distance metrics, cluster analysis and sampling.

**Note - Download instructions for software and materials can be found in Session 5**
