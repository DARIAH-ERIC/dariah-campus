Corpus data should be kept FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. This lecture will show how to do that using an example set-up in which the LINDAT repository is used for findability (as well as long-term preservation), TEITOK for accessibility (as well as maintenance and annotation), and TEI for interoperability and reusability. And we will show how to interact with these tools and standard both via a GUI (online) and using an API (to interact programmatically).
