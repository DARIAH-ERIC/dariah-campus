## Session 1 Python

To get the most out of this session you will need to have a few things downloaded to your machine.

**Anaconda**
Installing: Local installation of Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook)
[https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) (download)

**Google Collaborate**
You will use Google Collaborate to access files on your browser
[https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?hl=en](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?hl=en)

You will download files from this GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/sros-UNED/NLPforHumanist](https://github.com/sros-UNED/NLPforHumanist) download them through this link (code —> download zip)

## Session 5-8 Preparation Notes

The most important technical requirement for Day 2 would be [installing
R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and (preferably)
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (development environment for R that will
make things easier). We will use the `stylo` library for most of the day; see [step-by-step
introduction](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/stylo_nutshell/#) to `stylo` for beginners,
or the more extensive [HOW
TO](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo_howto/blob/master/stylo_howto.pdf).

In case you don't / can't install R and `stylo` locally, there will be an option to run analysis
from Colaboratory notebooks, just be aware it will require _more_ coding, not less coding, because
of the `stylo`'s interface that doesn't work in Colab.  You are free to bring your own collection of
texts to the workshop, but you can find more ready to use plain text fiction collections in
various languages on the [Computational Stylistics
website](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/).

## Materials

We will use GDrive folder
([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8KFkDxGpKvYqjbkymqukH1QdjwTJeak?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V8KFkDxGpKvYqjbkymqukH1QdjwTJeak?usp=sharing))
holds all necessary materials.

Your options are:

	- Download it and work locally.
	- Download -> re-upload folder to work in Colabs' virtual machine with R (or just open the
.ipynb notebook, then File -> Save a copy in Drive. It will create a copy of the notebook on your
own Drive.)

To copy folder to your own GDrive, do this:-

	- Download CLS_Madrid_Folder
	- Extract the downloaded .zip
	- Upload the extracted folder back to your GDrive
