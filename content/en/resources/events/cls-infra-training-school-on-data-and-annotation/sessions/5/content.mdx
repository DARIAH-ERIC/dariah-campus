This session is a continuation of the Base CQL session. It draws on queries about individual tokens and proceeds to queries on a sequence of tokens, introducing the concept of group referencing and metadata scope (e. g. within a single sentence). It also introduces aggregation and filtering functionalities of Kontext, the corpus manager used in the demonstration.
