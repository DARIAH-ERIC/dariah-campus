This session explains statistical considerations on frequency in corpus linguistics, mainly the statistical significance and effect size of a difference between two frequency counts. Besides, it introduces several quantitative stylistics metrics, such as different flavors of lexical richness, descriptivity vs. narrativity, thematic concentration, and thematic weights of individual words. Students learn about the on-line tools Calc and QuitaUp to calculate these metrics automatically.
