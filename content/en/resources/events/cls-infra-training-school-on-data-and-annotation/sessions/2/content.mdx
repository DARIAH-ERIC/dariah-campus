This session presents UDPipe, an NLP tool to analyse texts in more than seventy languages. UDPipe works with Universal Dependencies. Universal Dependencies is a framework for consistent grammar annotation across human languages. We particularly focus on its morphological annotation scheme, explaining the individual part-of-speech labels, as well as the more fine-grained morphological features, on English. A separate session deals with the syntactic markup.
