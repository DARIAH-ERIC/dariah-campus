This session introduces the basic principles of the XML markup and presents the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI-XML) guidelines as an encoding standard for digital editions and textual corpora. The students produce a valid TEI-XML document and upload it to TEITOK, our web-based platform for viewing, creating, and editing corpora with both rich textual mark-up and linguistic annotation.
