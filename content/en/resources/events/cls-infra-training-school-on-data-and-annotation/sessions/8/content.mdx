In this session, students gain the basic overview of the state of the art in the Named-Entity Recognition and Entity Linking (referring from a linguistic entity to an external knowledge base). They learn about the main Entity Linking authorities, such as WikiData and VIAAF. They get a hands-on experience with TEITOK's manual entity annotation module. Eventually, they get acquainted with TEITOK's bulk editing module.
