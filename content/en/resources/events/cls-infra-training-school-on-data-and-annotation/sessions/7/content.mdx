This is a continuation of the Universal Dependencies – Morphology session. It explains the principles of dependency grammar and its UD flavor, touching upon the interplay between the linguistic form and function, as well as ambiguity and vagueness in the linguistic annotation. We explain the principles of dependency grammar and elaborate on the most common syntactic labels and their typical usage.
