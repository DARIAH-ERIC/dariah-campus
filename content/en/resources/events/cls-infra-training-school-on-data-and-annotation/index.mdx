**What do I bring to prepare for the training?**

Corpus building is an integral part of this workshop. Therefore, you should have to hand a few text files of your own interest, for your individual hands-on experience with building a corpus. These files do not necessarily have to be in English.

**Who is this course for?**

This is an elementary course for actual beginners. If you have any NLP/programming skills, if you have ever built your own corpus or queried one beyond looking for a single word, or if you are well-versed in XML-TEI, this course would be too slow for you.

If you do have prior experience with the skills offered in this training school, you might still have fun scrolling through the teaching materials or apply for a fellowship to pursue your individual research or teaching project with the on-site support by our [CLS INFRA project partners](https://clsinfra.io/opportunities/tnafellowships/).
