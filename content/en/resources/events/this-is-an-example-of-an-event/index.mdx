## About

This is where you might write a detailed description of what the event covered, and what its purpose was in the context of the project or initiative that it came from.  It would be good to include a brief introduction to the main topic of the workshop and how this is going to be conveyed to the participants or learners. &#x20;

### Learning Outcomes

After following the sessions in this event, learners will be able to:

* Understand and convey the complexities of knitting and AI
* Begin their own project on Made Up Tool to cast on and begin their own AI knitting project
* Use some of the more advanced stitches in Made Up Tool to create AI garments.
