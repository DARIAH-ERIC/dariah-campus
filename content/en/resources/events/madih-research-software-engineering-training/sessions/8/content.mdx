## Abstract

The session focused on the concept of indigenous data sovereignty and its application to DH projects that deal with artefacts, data, images, and concepts that may be considered sacred, secret, or culturally sensitive by certain groups of people. Data sovereignty typically refers to the understanding that data is subject to the laws of the nation in which it is stored, whereas indigenous data sovereignty is a concept that reflects a conviction that data is subject to the laws of the nation from which it was collected (i.e. of the source community). These issues become most poignant when dealing with cultural artefacts from non-Western cultures (such as MƒÅori culture) or looted objects dispersed in Western collections and the dissemination of information about them. The tensions between Open Access principles and the requirements of Intellectual Property Rights/Management were highlighted. The session warned against presenting data without context, commercialisation without permission, and the use of data to the detriment of communities and advocated respect for and a need for consultation with the communities. The session formulated a set of questions to be considered when envisaging any DH project that may deal with data that is potentially sensitive for a group or groups of people, stressing the requirement for well-thought-through infrastructures for holding datasets as well as for consistent policies for data management and access.This session by Samantha Callaghan was presented by Dr James Smithies.
