## Abstract

This session covered a number of topics in best practices of design and development of Research Infrastructures with a particular focus on Research Data Management (RDM).It started with an outline of the "Open Access Chain" (Open standards – Open data – Open source – Open licenses – Open access), drawing on opportunities and challenges that an open approach to data presents in an RSE context. One of the key challenges is a necessity for a rigorous SDLC (software development lifecycle) process and adoption of common standards.Responding to the needs of data-intensive research and machine-actionability, FORCE11 coalition developed FAIR data principles that specify a set of requirements for data and metadata: data should be *findabile*, *accessible*, *interoperable* and *reusable*. To facilitate transition to FAIR data, Go-FAIR initiative developed a workflow ("FAIRification process") that guides researchers from retrieval of non-FAIR data to deployment of FAIR data resources.In the session, the place of RDM in the software development lifecycle at KDL was discussed. The nature of Agile projects that KDL often works with, however, means that in many cases the project begins before any data is collected or data collection continues throughout evolutionary development requiring monitoring methods and forward-planning to be in place and exercised throughout the SDLC.With proliferation of data, questions of privacy are more and more pressing. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became directly applicable in all EU states on 25 May 2018 and requires informed consent to process personal data. In this context, the history of the regulation and its implications for DH projects, both legal and ethical, were discussed.The final topic of the session was the challenges related to software sustainability and citation, including the tension between the need for openness and reusability and a requirement for appropriate citation giving credit to contributors to every stage of the project. In order to ensure adequate monitoring of the project at every stage of its development, issues of Versioning, Sharing, Documentation, Licensing, Publishing (e.g. via Zenodo) need to be addressed.
