## Abstract

The second part of the session introduced the concept of “Double Diamond” – a visual map of the design process (developed and described by the [Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond)). The Double Diamond model posits the necessity, for any creative process, to spend time defining the problem before setting out to solve it. Therefore, the process is divided into four distinct phases – Discover (a problem), Define (the problem), Develop (a solution) and Deliver (the solution).These four phases can be mapped onto two of the three stages of KDL's workflow which comprises

1. Pre-project (Discover/Define)
2. Project development from start to launch (Define, Design and Develop)
3. Post project (maintenance, archiving and decommission)The second phase of project evolutionary development is an iterative cycle that evolves as development progresses.The rest of the session was dedicated to detailed analysis of workflows by RSE role (Project Manager; Analyst; Software Engineer; UI/UX Designer; Systems Manager) with the tasks mapped onto the three stages of KDL project workflow, from Pre-project through Project development to Post-project.
