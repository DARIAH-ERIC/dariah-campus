## Abstract

The first part of the session began with the description of team roles at KDL, aligned with a holistic vision of Research Software Engineering (RSE) career paths plotted in a continuum from research active to research support profiles, mappable to best practices in industry standards such as development and management frameworks (in particular the Agile Dynamic Systems Development Method: DSDM) and competence skills (e.g. SFIA). These roles and promotion processes were compared and contrasted with traditional roles and promotion processes in academia on the one hand, and industry on the other. Focusing on the example of the analyst role, the range of tasks and responsibilities inherent to the role was demonstrated.In what followed, infrastructures and frameworks used at KDL, the lifecycle of a typical project and its SDLC were outlined, beginning with initial contact by the partner (i.e. an academic, a research institution or a business) through to funding application, release and post-project hosting and maintenance. Sources of funding and classification of projects according to size were also discussed.KDL members of staff work on several projects in different stages of development at the same time, and in order to manage the workflow most effectively, the team has implemented flexible “timebox planning”, whereby tasks are planned for each “timebox” (two-week period) and then are revised according to priority and resources. In order to manage and document the processes effectively, KDL has developed a set of templates for project governance documentation corresponding to each stage of the project SDLC (such as “Terms of Reference”, “Feasibility”, “Product Quote”, “Project Review Record” and “Service Level Agreement (SLA))”. Simplified templates with contextual information on use can be consulted by accessing KDL's repository on GitHub.
