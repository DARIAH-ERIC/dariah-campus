## Abstract

*King's Digital Lab: Overview and Context*

The session gave an overview of the institutional context of the workshop, mentioning over 30 years of history of Humanities Computing and Digital Humanities (DH) at King's College London and presented King's Digital Lab (KDL), founded in 2015; KDL's place and role within the university, its team, infrastructure, activities, projects, funding strategy, partners and collaborators were briefly discussed. The session dwelled on emerging as well as core research themes and directions for KDL, such as immersive experiences, software development, archiving and sustainability, machine learning and big data analysis, design, visualisation and indigenous DH. The last part of the session focused on the contexts in which KDL operates that necessitate a balance between a drive for innovation and focus on continuity and value, between experimentation and institutional responsibility. In order to address the scale and complexity of contemporary DH projects and infrastructures, KDL has adopted and adapted industry standards, broadly accepted research data management workflows and clearly defined processes for documentation and software development lifecycle (SDLC).
