## Abstract

This session started with a discussion of the concepts of Data, Information and Knowledge. A data model, i.e. a *formalised description of how to organize data in an information system*, is the backbone of most RSE evolving solutions. One way of modelling data is by creating an ontology, that is an explicit set of relational statements connecting entities (e.g. artefacts, places, people, events). Ontologies not only help organise data for the purposes of a particular project, they also make future integration and reuse of structured data possible.The session traced the meaning of the term “ontology” from philosophy to data modelling, where it is used to designate conceptualisation and agreed upon representation of data about a knowledge domain.There are two approaches to building ontologies. One can be described as realist (that strives to render full complexity), the other as pragmatic (that focuses on representation of data best suited for the project and purpose in question). Due to the often complex and ambiguous nature of data in the Humanities and Cultural Heritage sectors, DH scholars often favour the pragmatic approach. In order to understand the concept of ontology, metaphors such as “agreement”, “contract” or “compromise” were introduced as useful semantic devices in the data modelling process. Access to expert knowledge about the domain and reflection on the future uses of the data were discussed as essential constituent parts of this process.After analysing a set of examples from the “Henry III Fine Rolls” project, the session concluded with a detailed discussion of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) as a guide for good practice in conceptual modelling in the Humanities and Cultural Heritage.The afternoon of Day Two was dedicated to a visit to the [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhrSG-Ymp5wIVWODtCh15GAg3EAAYASAAEgI91_D_BwE) led by Dominic Oldman and Diana Tanase.
