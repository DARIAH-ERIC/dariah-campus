[OpenEdition](http://www.openedition.org/?lang=en) gathers four platforms for open access publications in humanities and social sciences: journals, books, scientific programs and academic blogs. Based in France, OpenEdition initiated specific programs in several European countries to be able to offer an international and multilingual infrastructure, currently disseminating online and open access more than half million academic documents coming from more than twenty countries in 14 languages. OpenEdition aims now at developing a distributed European wide infrastructure with 19 partners. Named [OPERAS](http://operas.hypotheses.org/), this new initiative will foster cooperation at European scale and help humanities and social sciences join the common effort for the development of Open Science.
