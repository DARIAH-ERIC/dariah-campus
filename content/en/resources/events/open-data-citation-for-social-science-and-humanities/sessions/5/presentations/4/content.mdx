In Holland, there are around four hundred organizations keeping a collection from or about the Netherlands in the Second World War. The program 'Network of Dutch war sources' (Netwerk Oorlogsbronnen) intends to make the geographically scattered sources digital findable and usable. We do that by engaging in or leading small projects with several participating organizations. For example creating a second world war â€“ thesaurus, implemented in collection management systems. The use of OCR and NER-techniques to make millions of documents accessible on a document level. And adding persistent geographical codes to sources to enhance searching with a focus on location.The Network of Dutch War sources is a program of 'NIOD institute for war holocaust and genocide'. See [www.oorlogsbronnen.nl](http://www.oorlogsbronnen.nl) for more information about the program.
