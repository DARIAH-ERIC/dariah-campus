This presentation will discuss the research project aiming to transform a vast database of Polish Literary Bibliography (PBL) into a fully operational, digital research infrastructure for the study of Polish literature and culture of 20th century. The project entails retrodigitisation and transformation of the existing records into a coherent database as well as the development of data analysis tools for literary researchers. PBL is a specialized bibliography containing records about various types of materials concerning literature and literary scholarship (e.g. literary works, books, journals, magazines, articles, documents, dramas, movies, TV programs, conferences, awards, etc.), which are annotated in the unique semantic framework. In that respect it is similar to other national projects such as ABELL (Annual Bibliography of English Language and Literature). The online database contains records for 1988-2002 with printed volumes covering the period 1939-1987. In my presentation I would like to focus on the following issues:- Challenges: the methodological problems of dealing with data collected during a long stretch of 60 years, including the conversion of OCR'd scans into a database.
- Standards: choosing the right ontology for the data and mapping our resources onto it.
- Interoperability: plans to link the resources with LOD cloud and other bibliographies (hopefully with the Bibliography of Czech Literature too).
