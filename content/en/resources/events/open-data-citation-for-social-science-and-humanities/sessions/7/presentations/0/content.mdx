The development of open access in humanities and social sciences faces a major challenge: sustainability. Whereas in STM disciplines, the new dissemination paradigm means shifting from reader-pays model to author-pays model, the infamous "APC", in humanities and social sciences that type of reconfiguration is simply not possible for many good reasons. Moreover, the dissemination of knowledge in those disciplines is mostly done through books and not solely in journals, which entails additional complications. Therefore, those who want to develop open access in SSH have to find their own solution, that fits with their specific ecosystem. Whether it be based on donations, grants, subscriptions, in kind contributions, crowdfunding or "freemium" model, the are many ongoing experimentations under development. A landscape of the different models and the main trends on the topic will be presented.
