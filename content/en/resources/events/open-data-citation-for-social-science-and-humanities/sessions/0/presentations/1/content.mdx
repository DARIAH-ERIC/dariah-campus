The presentation will investigate the relationship between data and text in different document types, in social sciences and humanities. It will introduce different categories and types of research data, make the link with research fields and methods, and add some comments about differences between SS\&H and STM. It will also question the future of the distinction between documents and data, in the environment of content mining. Other issues will be addressed for further discussion: sharing and reusage of data; impact and evaluation of data; the link between document, data life cycle and the research process; identification, curation and preservation; and the function of data in the new context of open science. What is data? What is NOT data? What is functional and dysfunctional in the field of data management and data publishing? May be that at the end there are more open questions than answers.
