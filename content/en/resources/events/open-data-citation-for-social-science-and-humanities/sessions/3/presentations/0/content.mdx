The proliferation of datasets and services available online invites researchers to link them from their works. A link to a service, that makes it possible to explore the data in question yourself, might be more valuable than a picture. But these types of online resources and/or the infrastructures they live in are constantly evolving. Which effectively leads to dead links or links to a different version of the resource. PID systems can help with keeping the locations of resources up to date as well as store information about what the resource is.
