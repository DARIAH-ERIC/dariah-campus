For five months, the OA journal Vertigo experimented both open peer review and open commentary devices within its scientific blog. While the first consisted strictly in opening a classical pre-publication review process, the second was inviting the whole “scientific community” to comment pre-publications in order to improve them before submission. In both of the two devices, every reviews, comments and annotations are accessible to everyone online, as the authors, reviewers and commentators names. The sociologist in charge of this project will present the details of the experiment, its main results – need of human mediation, technical possibilities and limitations – and will try to raise the questions and potentialities issued by new forms of reviewing in academic publishing.
