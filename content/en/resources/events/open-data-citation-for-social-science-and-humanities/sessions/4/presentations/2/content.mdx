*Data informed research evaluation: challenges of data collection and data standardisation in the SSH.*

Evaluation has always been perceived as a difficult area for the SSH for a number of reasons. One of the problems is the fact that the most common procedures have been fine-tuned to the so-called hard sciences and as such are ill adapted the SSH disciplines. While abundant information exists about research practices, disciplinary biases and dissemination traditions in STEM fields, the situation is at least contrasted between Nordic and Southern countries with regards to the monitoring of the research production/outputs in SSH disciplines. This presentation will briefly introduce the [COST Action CA15137](http://enressh.eu/), dedicated to the creation of a network of evaluators for the SSH disciplines, then will focus on the needs and the challenges of data collection for an informed peer evaluation of the SSH.
