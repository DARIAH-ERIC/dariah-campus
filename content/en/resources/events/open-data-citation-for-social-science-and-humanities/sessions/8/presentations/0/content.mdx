This talk will discuss the impact on scholarship when data sharing is increasingly organized by social media platforms. It does so by contrasting these entities with existing data infrastructures that acquire, curate, and process these data for archiving and further dissemination. The analysis of routine, procedures, and everyday work of data processing staff at a social science data archive will provide elements to detail the “regime of care” that define infrastructure towards research data, and how it contrasts with digital intermediaries in organizing data circulation.
