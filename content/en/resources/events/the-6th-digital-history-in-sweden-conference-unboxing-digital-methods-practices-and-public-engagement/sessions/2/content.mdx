[Global Archives Online](https://calib.ro/global-archive) is a directory of open digital collections for the study of colonial and global history. Aimed primarily at students and researchers interested in imperial, colonial, and global history, the directory provides users worldwide with an overview of major digital collections containing a variety of primary sources, including digitized manuscripts, newspapers, books, pamphlets, maps, images, and audiovisual material. A powerful search function allows users to quickly identify relevant collections. Global Archives Online is maintained by the Linnaeus University Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies as a free service to the global community of researchers and students.

Linked to the directory, the Global Archives Online Graduate School (GAO-S) is an interdisciplinary and international initiative organized by Stockholm University in collaboration with Linnaeus University and Lund University, along with PhD students from universities in Sweden and abroad. Offered in a hybrid format during the fall term of 2024, GAO-S focuses on two primary aims: the methodological development of digital archive work and the pedagogical enhancement of undergraduate supervision. The program seeks to foster a bottom-up dialogue between scholars and students both within and beyond Swedish research institutions. In this talk, two of the authors, Prof. Stefan Amirell and Simon Ottosson, present the GAO-S project and share key pedagogical insights gathered during the initial months of teaching.
