Historical discussions regarding early modern women of color, free and enslaved, have predominantly been framed around the "silence of the archive", highlighting how stories and voices of women of color have been hidden from archival sources. While documents concerning free and enslaved Black women are disproportionately harder to find than those of white administrators, they are not as rare as is often imagined. The question is rather, what does one do with documents concerning Black women, and how should they be considered? In this lecture, Dr. Ale PÃ¥lsson and Dr. Annika Raapke discuss the intersection between Michel-Rolph Trouillot's "archival silencing" and the information avalanche of digital archives.
