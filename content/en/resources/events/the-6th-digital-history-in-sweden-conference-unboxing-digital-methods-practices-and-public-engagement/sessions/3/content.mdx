A lot has been said about cultural theories as well as debates in archival science regarding the digitization of colonial archives.  The collection "Joseph Stephens' time in India" (1860-1869) in the Joseph Stephens Archive is a collection of papers which migrated with Stephens from Bombay to the Huseby estate in southern Sweden at the end of the 1860s. The collection contains rare sources about contractors and sub-contractors, the relations between them, and their relation to the colonial state and the informal labour force's composition and work conditions during an intensive period of infrastructural expansion in India. In this paper, Dr Eleonor Marcussen begins by charting the history of the collection in order to contextualize the arguments for preservation and access which has resulted in its digitization. She then points to the possibilities and limitations of using digitized migrated archives by discussing how connections and infrastructure can enable access and shed light on the limits of the official colonial archives.
