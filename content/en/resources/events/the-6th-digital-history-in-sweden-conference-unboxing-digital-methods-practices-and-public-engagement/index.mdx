Whether or not it is a conscious choice, most digital history projects involve, engage, or inform the public in some way. This can be anything from crowdsourcing or creating a digital educational resource, to inadvertently enabling easy access to newly digitized material for everyone – not just researchers. Historians need to be aware of the potential of the digital in the dissemination and collection of historical knowledge, as well as the vital role they play in providing a context for local histories. This conference aims to address this issues.

Fusing the sharing of memories and amateur history-writing online – where it can easily be disseminated – means that historians have started to be more aware of and open to the public's role in collecting memories and sources, building networks, and enabling cross-border, non-Eurocentric ways of writing history. The internationalization of access to sources and histories leads to academic and amateur historians gaining insights into regions that previously were inaccessible, yet infrastructures for citizen participation remain limited to only a few. In many ways, digital methods, practices, and public engagement put a spotlight on history's relationship with collective memory and how interactive practices, collaborations, and co-creation affect both the field and the public in general.

In the following talks, selected from the _6th Digital History in Sweden Conference_, the learner will gain new perspectives on the use of AI and citizen science in digitization and digital history projects. In addition, the learner will gain insight into the creation and care of digital archives applying postcolonial perspectives.

The conference was organized by the Division of History at the Department of Cultural Sciences, with support from the Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies and Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, Linnaeus University, Sweden.
