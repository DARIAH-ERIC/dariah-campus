    Digital Integrated Strategies to Safeguard Heritage Construction
    Technologies
  content: >-
    The international workshop Digital Integrated Strategies to Safeguard
    Heritage Construction Technologies, funded by the DARIAH Working Group
    Activities 2023–2025 programme, was organised by the CNR Institute of
    Heritage Science in collaboration with the Cyprus Institute and the
    University of Catania, with support from the Municipality of Poggioreale. It
    focused on advancing digital approaches to the conservation, restoration,
    and reuse of tangible and intangible heritage related to construction
    technologies. Through discussions and field sessions, participants explored
    HBIM as a key tool for heritage management, emphasizing data acquisition,
    interoperability, and collaboration across architecture, conservation, and
    digital humanities.
