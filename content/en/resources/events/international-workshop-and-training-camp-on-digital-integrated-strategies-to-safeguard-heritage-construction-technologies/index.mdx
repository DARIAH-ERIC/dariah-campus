    Digital Integrated Strategies to Safeguard Heritage Construction
    Technologies
  content: >-
    The international workshop DIGITAL INTEGRATED STRATEGIES TO SAFEGUARD
    HERITAGE CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES is funded by the “DARIAH Funding Scheme
    for Working Group Activities 2023-2025” programme, which supported  the
    Working Groups of DARIAH ERIC, specifically the new ARCHETIPO Working Group,
    encouraging the development of innovative projects, new services, tools, and
    training activities.

    The workshop, organised by the Institute of Heritage Science of the CNR, in
    collaboration with the Cyprus Institute and the University of Catania, with
    the support of the Municipality of Poggioreale, was  dedicated to discussing
    and developing initiatives to improve the conservation and management of
    cultural heritage through advanced digital technologies, promoting
    collaboration among various working groups and resource sharing.

    The workshop aimed to promote a digital approach to the conservation,
    restoration, and reuse of tangible and intangible heritage knowledge related
    to construction technologies. The event intended to strengthen ties with
    local communities, including scholars, researchers, and authorities,
    facilitating the exchange of knowledge in the fields of architecture and
    Digital Humanities. The expected outcomes contributed to DARIAH’s mission of
    advancing research in the humanities through the development of original
    databases, access to resources, and the development of digital skills. The
    dissemination of the knowledge produced by the workshop through the
    DARIAH-Campusincreased the visibility and accessibility of digital
    methodologies and strategies.

    During the workshop, discussions and practical field sessions will focued on
    implementing digital methodologies and strategies in researching
    informational models capable of systematically representing the rules and
    systems of construction art in specific geographic and historical contexts
    within the European territory. The potential of HBIM (Heritage Building
    Information Modelling)  was  explored as a key tool in architectural
    heritage management and restoration, applying best practices in data
    acquisition, management, and sharing processes.

    The workshop brought  together international experts in the fields of
    architecture, engineering, conservation, and technology to explore the
    potential of HBIM modelling as a key tool in managing and restoring
    historical buildings. Participants ad h the opportunity to learn the best
    practices in the data acquisition process, from 3D scanning to data
    collection, and the subsequent creation of BIM models respecting good
    practices of knowledge representation for data interoperability.
