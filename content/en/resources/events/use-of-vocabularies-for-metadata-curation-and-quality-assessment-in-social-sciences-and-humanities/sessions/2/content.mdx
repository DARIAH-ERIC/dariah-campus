The GoTriple platform is a discovery service for SSH publications. During the ingestion pipeline, it transforms metadata records into the Triple Data Model, it performs a series of cleansing, normalization and enrichment procedures - in order to deal with metadata heterogeneity, increase multilingualism and improve content searchability and discoverability - and, finally, it stores and indexes the enriched metadata records, making them searchable via the GoTriple search engine. During this process, many vocabularies are involved having a strategic role in the quality of the results and by extension in the satisfaction of the end users of the platform. What are these vocabularies? Where are they used and how? What are the difficulties encountered in the framework of GoTriple? We will try to answer these questions during the session.
