SSH Open Marketplace ([https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu)) acts as a place to get information on tools, services, training materials, publications, datasets, and workflows from the Social Sciences and Humanities domain. Users can propose to add new items or to extend the information about existing items. SSH Open Marketplace data model operates with dynamic fields that can be connected to vocabularies. The presentation gives information about the technical background of the integration of vocabularies and shares experiences with this approach. On the 'SSH vocabs commons' project the used vocabularies of the SSH Open Marketplace are represented. Ideas on how to further develop the 'SSH vocabs commons' project are discussed from the perspective of the SSH Open Marketplace.
