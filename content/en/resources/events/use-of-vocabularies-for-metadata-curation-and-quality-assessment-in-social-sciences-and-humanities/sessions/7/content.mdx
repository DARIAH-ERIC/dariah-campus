The OpenAIRE Graph is an open collection of metadata about entities of the research life cycle (publication, research data, software, other types of research results, project grants, organisations, data sources) semantically linked with each other. Metadata and links are collected from trusted scholarly communication sources (like institutional repositories, data archives, publishers' platforms, Crossref, DOAJ) and enriched thanks to data mining algorithms that detect duplicates, semantic relationships and subject classification. The talk will present how controlled vocabularies are used in the OpenAIRE Graph, focusing on those used for subject classification and how they are leveraged by the OpenAIRE services CONNECT, EXPLORE and MONITOR.
