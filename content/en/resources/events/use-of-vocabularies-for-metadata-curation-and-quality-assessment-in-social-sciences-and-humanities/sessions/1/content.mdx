The SSHOC Multilingual Terminologies consist of a set of multilingual metadata concepts and an automatically extracted multilingual Data Stewardship terminology. They have been created in the context of the SSHOC project as case studies, during an activity of investigation on how Language Technologies can help in promoting and facilitating multilingualism in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The SSHOC Multilingual terminologies has been created to evaluate performances of state-of-the-art tools and to derive a set of recommendations as to how best apply them. The talk will present the main recommendations derived from the investigation and the workflow and tools adopted to publish the Terminologies as SKOS resources.
