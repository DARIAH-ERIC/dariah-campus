summary:
  content: This event, organised in the framework of the TRIPLE project, provided
    insights into the use of "topical vocabularies" and their use in metadata
    curation and quality assessment in the Social Sciences and Humanities (in
    the EOSC context). The sessions introduces learners to have a better
    understanding of the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH
    branch of the EOSC, and be familiar with some initiatives related to
    metadata curation and enrichment in the SSH.

The event "Use of vocabularies for metadata curation and quality assessment in
social sciences and humanities" was organised as part of the Horizon 2020
funded project TRIPLE (Grant Agreement No. 863420.).
https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/863420 The starting point for the
organisation of this event was to analyse the challenges faced to create the
multilingual GoTRIPLE vocabulary and compare it with other initiatives
recently undertaken in the Social Sciences and Humanities branch of the
European Science Cloud (EOSC) context.

## Learning outcomes

This event resource targets an audience already knowledgeable in the field. By following the resources, you should be able to:

- have a better understanding the current situation concerning topical vocabularies in the SSH context and the interoperability challenges faced within/by the SSH branch of the EOSC;
- be familiar with some initiatives related to metadata curation and enrichment in the SSH;
- apply best practices solutions when applying a vocabulary to a dataset.
