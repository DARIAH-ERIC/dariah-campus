## Description

After a [first workshop](https://www.unine.ch/dariah-ch/home.html) held in November 2018, the University of Neuchâtel hosted a second DARIAH-CH workshop on December 5-6 2019.

For this event, young scholars were invited to present their research in depth and to discuss together methodological, data management and research workflow issues.

In addition, DARIAH organised during these two days training sessions on sustainable data workflows in the Arts and Humanities by the DARIAH Open Science officer, Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra.

We are happy to present on DARIAH-Campus the papers resulting from this meeting.
