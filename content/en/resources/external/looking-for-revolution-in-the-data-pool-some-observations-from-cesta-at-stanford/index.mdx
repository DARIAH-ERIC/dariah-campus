In this lecture entitled "Looking for Revolution in the Data Pool: Some Observations from CESTA at Stanford", Professor Baker discusses two projects. 'Writing Rights', on which he is engaged at Stanford University in collaboration with Dan Edelstein (Professor of French) and specialists in academic technology and design from Stanford and Sydney, Australia, seeks to use techniques of textual analysis and visualisation to understand the process by which the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was drafted in 1789. 'Revolutionising Revolution', his contribution to the volume he has edited with Dan Edelstein on 'Scripting Revolution.  A Historical Approach to the Comparative Study of Revolution', has explored the transformation of the meaning of 'revolution' between 1650 and 1789. Both projects are discussed in light of using Digital Humanities tools for analysis.

The ACDH Lecture addresses the Digital Humanities dimensions of both projects against the academic background at Stanford. This event immediately follows a workshop at the University of Vienna and is co-organized by the Austrian Science Fund Project "Benedictines, Church Reform and the State in Austria, 1720-40" (P-28016).
