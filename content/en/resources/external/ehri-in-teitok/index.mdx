summary:
  content: This blog examines TEITOK, which is a corpus framework used as an
    alternative to Omeka. TEITOK is centered around texts and is similar to the
    Omeka interface – both allow you to search through the documents, and
    display the transcription. The main difference is that Omeka treats the
    transcription as an object description, whereas TEITOK not only shows that a
    word appears in a document, but also where it appears and how it is used.

The Institute for Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL) put together an experimental interface for the EHRI digital editions, a corpus framework called TEITOK, as an alternative to the current interface in Omeka. Where the current interface of EHRI based is centered around documents, TEITOK is centered around texts. In many aspects, the TEITOK interface for EHRI is similar to the Omeka interface – both allow you to search through the documents, and display the transcription. The main difference is that in Omeka, when you search for a word in the documents, it is not aware where that term appears in the text – the transcription is treated as an object description. Since TEITOK is aware where the words appear, it can not only show that a word appears in a document, but also where it appears and how it is used.

In this document, we will first quickly explain what TEITOK is, and then describe the design of the experimental EHRI interface, as well as how it was created and how the result differs from the Omeka interface of EHRI. The first two parts are unavoidable technical in nature. That is why the last section illustrates the resulting system using some actual examples from the EHRI project.
