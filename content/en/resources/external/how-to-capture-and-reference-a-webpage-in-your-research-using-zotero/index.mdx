The need to reference webpages in academic work is growing all the time, particularly in the digital humanities. There are many different reference management systems that exist to help researchers sort and find their sources, and the most accessible of these is Zotero. This short guide will show you how to use Zotero to capture webpages that can then be cited in your work.

If you have not come across Zotero before, it is an open access tool that helps you collect, organise, cite and share research. To download Zotero, go to *[https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)*

You will need to download both the standalone version as well as the Zotero connector for your web browser (in this example Firefox). There are different Zotero connectors depending on the web browser you are using.
