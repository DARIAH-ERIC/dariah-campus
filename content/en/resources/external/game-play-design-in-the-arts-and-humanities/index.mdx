This course introduces you to the definition of games, core concepts and theories from game studies as well as the cultural importance of games and the critical potentials and possibilities for change that games hold.

You will also learn about the process of designing games (also for newcomers and non-designers), the game jam format and the potentials and benefits of doing game jams. You will get to make a game concept in 10 minutes as well as try out the game jam format.
