In this tutorial, you learn about the typical methods for obtaining high-quality scanned images, setting the stage for successful text recognition processes. It outlines obtaining digital copies from archives, digitisation needs, and copyright considerations. It also covers using online resources like Google Books and Internet Archive while navigating public domain copyright issues. Lastly, it highlights the Heritage Data Reuse Charter for collaboration between cultural heritage institutions and researchers.
