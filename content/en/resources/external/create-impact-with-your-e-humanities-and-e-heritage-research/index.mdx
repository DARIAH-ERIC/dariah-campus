This is a record of a webinar dedicated to the phase of the Research Lifecycle "Publish Results". It covers several aspects related to successfully drafting and implementing a publication and dissemination strategy taking into account specific Research Infrastructural aspects. It first covers the basics of impact measurement and research metrics, both from the individual researcher's perspective as well as the Research Infrastructure perspective since these are strongly interlinked. It then goes into details such as repositories, new publication types and new forms of dissemination (such as blogs or wikis) and touches upon challenges such as data and software citation. It specifically introduces the Impactomatrix as a tool for drafting an impact-orientated publication and dissemination strategy.
