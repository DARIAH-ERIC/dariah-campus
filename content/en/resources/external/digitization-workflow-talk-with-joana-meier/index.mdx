What does "curating data stories" mean from a technical and academic perspective?  In this podcast, produced by virtualculture.ch, sociologist Jane Haller, president of the Digitales Schaudepot, is in conversation with Joana Meier a Master's student in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel, working in museum education and digitization.  Throughout their conversation, they discuss the processes of data visualisation, and how digitalization has opened up new research questions.

As a winning project of the DARIAH Thematic Funding Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoiding unwanted missteps. To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted 3 interviews which were turned into podcasts for wider broadcast.
