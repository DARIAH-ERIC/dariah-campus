  content: The Performing Arts' aesthetic and poetry can be sometimes
    destabilising at first glance and difficult to analyse because it is
    ephemeral by nature.  The E-Spectator tool enables annotation of videos to
    better analyse and understand the performing arts.  This course from
    dariahTeach introduces learners to the E-Spectator tool, with practical
    examples and quizzes to guide you along.

Performing Arts are artistic disciplines such as dance, music or theatre that involve the realisation of a "performance": that is, they compose an event whose action and temporal unfolding create the artistic work. It is, therefore, an artistic practice that is expressed and appreciated in its realisation, not in its result.  For this reason t﻿he Performing Arts' aesthetic and poetry can be sometimes destabilising at first glance and difficult to analyse because it is ephemeral by nature. Yet the Performative Arts are bearers of an alternative vision of the world that allows us to maintain a critical view of events and our environment.

This training course introduces the E-Spectator tool for analysis of performing arts.  The E-Spectator tool enables students and pupils to better understand and analyse the Performing Arts through annotation of videos of plays, dance, and other performative activities such as fashion shows, providing new methods for their study along with digital technology.
