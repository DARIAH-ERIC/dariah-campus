This resource provides guidance on how to use digital storytelling, deploying 3D data, annotations and combining media to enable users to access and explore information about digital heritage assets over the web.

Storytelling is a useful way to engage users with cultural heritage projects, their assets and stories. Storytelling is a large domain, here we focus on the stories which are easily enabled by accessible web-tools and 3D content incorporating interactivity. Interactivity allows users to access detailed information on 3D models.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, learners will:

* Understand digital storytelling and explain why publishing and sharing 3D models over the web is important to allow for access, dissemination and interpretation of cultural heritage.
* Illustrate some of the available options for publishing 3D models over the web, while being compliant with FAIR principles.
* Test various platforms for publishing and creating annotations for 3D models and produce an example of digital storytelling with 3D data and other media.
