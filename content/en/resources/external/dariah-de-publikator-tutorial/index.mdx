Likewise, the repository makes it possible to store data collections sustainably and securely. With the help of the DARIAH-DE Publikator, research data can easily be imported into the DARIAH-DE Repository via a graphical user interface and tagged with metadata. These research data can be described as a collection in the DARIAH-DE Collection Registry and are then identified in the DARIAH-DE Generic Search.

The tutorial is conveniently divided into several sections. The user guides give step-by-step instructions on how to use the DARIAH-DE Publikator. This is presented in three parts: Collections, Log in with a DARIAH-DE Account or with a Federation Account, and Publishing with the DARIAH-DE Publikator. The technical documentation explains in detail how the DARIAH-DE Publikator works by presenting its service APIs.
