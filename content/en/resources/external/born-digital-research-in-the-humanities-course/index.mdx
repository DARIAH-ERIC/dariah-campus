summary:
  content: Born-digital culture refers to materials, environments and practices
    that originate in a digital form. In the 21st century these have rapidly
    expanded, with many of our contemporary cultural practices increasingly
    mediated in some way by digital media and technologies. In this course,
    designed by the Digital Humanities Research Hub at the School of Advanced
    Study, University of London, you will explore key concepts associated with
    digital culture and archives, ethical issues, and how to collect and analyse
    born-digital materials.

This free online course is designed to equip humanities researchers and practitioners at all career stages with the knowledge needed to engage with the new research challenges and opportunities associated with the rapid expansion of born-digital materials and archives in the 21st century. The course will introduce key concepts associated with digital culture and born-digital archives and provide an overview of key ethical and legal issues involved in born-digital research. The course also includes a range of research examples and hands-on activities that will provide researchers with a critical and practical understanding of different methods and approaches for collecting and analysing born-digital materials.Â 

The course is fully asynchronous and while it does not include any formal assessment, you will receive a certificate upon completion of the course materials. The course is hosted on the School of Advanced Study's RESHAPED research training platform for the humanities and you will need to create a free account in order to track your learning and receive a certificate of completion.
