  title: Data Analysis with Python
  content: This course from dariahTeach introduces learners to the theoretical and
    practical foundations of an analysis of socio-cultural objects using Python
    through theoretical grounding and hands-on case studies.  Students will work
    through several research use cases using basic machine learning, and employ
    network analysis to split a small community network into groups and clusters
    before finally learning more about visualisation and image analysis.

Social media analytics extends general analytics toward analysing social (media) relationships. Cultural analytics builds on successful analytical methods and applies its techniques and methods to studying cultural objects.

In this course, you will learn about the theoretical and practical foundations of an analysis of socio-cultural objects. While experimenting, you will also learn about the limits of the current capacities and the exciting opportunities.
