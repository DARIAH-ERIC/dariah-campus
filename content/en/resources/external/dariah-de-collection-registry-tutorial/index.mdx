If you are searching for a tool that enables you to describe and index data collections, the DARIAH-DE Collection Registry might be the perfect one for you.

Via a graphical user interface, you can describe your collections in different categories, depending on the metadata you have available. Not only digital collections but also analogous collections can be described.
