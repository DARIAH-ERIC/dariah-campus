How do we display data as we want, but still store it as we should?  This podcast, produced by virtualculture.ch, offers the data steward's perspective on digitisation.  Sociologist Jane Haller is in conversation with data steward Sorin Marti (based at the Research Infrastructure Support Entity at the University of Basel) about what it means to make data available from the 'front end' while still maintaining the data integrity behind the scenes.

As a winning project of the Dariah Theme Call 2022-2024 on Workflows, we evaluated a showcase project called “curiositas5.0”, initiated by the Digitales Schaudepot Association (DSD) intended to assist in planning projects and, above all, avoid unwanted missteps. To capture voices from the community and provide insight into the different working methods, expertise, and backgrounds of the people collaborating on the curiositas5.0 project, we conducted 3 interviews.
