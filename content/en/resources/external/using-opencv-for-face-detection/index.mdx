OpenCV is a very popular, free and open source software system used for a large variety of computer vision applications. This article is intended to help you get started in experimenting with OpenCV, using an example of face detection in images as a case study.

Face detection is a different, and much simpler task than facial recognition. Face detection uses a computer vision algorithm to detect the existence and location of face images within an image file. Facial recognition can be used to identify a person or match face images with each other.

This article assumes you have Linux installed and available to you and you can log in to the command line terminal.
