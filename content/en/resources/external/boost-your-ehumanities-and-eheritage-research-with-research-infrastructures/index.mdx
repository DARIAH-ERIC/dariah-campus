This is a record of a webinar dedicated to the phase of the research life cycle "Develop Research Questions". It dives into details of the topic of developing research questions with RIs, especially on finding, working with and contributing data to RI collections, using Virtual Research Environments, and tools. It shows successful examples of how Digital Humanities and eHeritage approaches, in cooperation with relevant Research Infrastructures, lead to innovative research methods and questions.

It also exemplifies how to successfully involve the broader public in Digital Humanities and eHeritage research (citizen science). This webinar cross-links to materials developed within PARTHENOS and by the PARTHENOS Cluster Partners and features "teasers" from several research infrastructures as well as an introduction of the Cultural Heritage Data Reuse Charter.
