Georeferencing is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to a scanned map or raster image.
Many historians are now georeferencing historical maps to study how places have changed over time.
After georeferencing a historic map, you may want to display it online to share your research or
tell a story. In this lesson from Programming Historian, we will show you how to share a
georeferenced map online using StoryMap JS, an interactive web-based mapping platform. StoryMap JS
is an open-source tool from Knight Lab at Northwestern University, which allows you to integrate
historical and contemporary maps into interactive stories.
