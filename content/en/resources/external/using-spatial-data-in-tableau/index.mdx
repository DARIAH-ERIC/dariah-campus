Tableau is a powerful digital tool for analysing data. In this short guide we will focus on an aspect of data analysis using mapping that has particular application for Holocaust and refugee studies. Sometimes just simply mapping your data is not enough, and you want to use other features such as changing the size of a marker above a location in order to demonstrate the number of people from that town or city. Tableau can help with this and can be used for free for 14 days, or is available free of charge to individuals teaching or researching at an academic institution. For more information about Tableau and to download the software see *[https://www.tableau.com/](https://www.tableau.com/)*

Using Tableau it is possible to import a variety of files. For the purpose of this guide the example will be based on a .csv file, but the same principles apply to Excel spreadsheets.
