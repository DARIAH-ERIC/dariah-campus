This course introduces learners to the concept of Cultural Heritage, Storytelling, and explores how Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to create interactive learning experiences based on digitised cultural heritage assets. Learners will also be actively involved in designing and developing their own digitally content-rich materials. Case studies include Choirokoitia in Cyprus and Sandby Borg in Sweden.

## L﻿earning Outcomes

A﻿fter completing course, learners should be able to:

* understand key principles of Cultural Heritage and its role in present societies
* evaluate the utilisation of digital tools in preserving and communicating cultural heritage assets
* understand key principles of digital storytelling, Augmented Reality, and game-based learning
* develop basic skills in digital tools such as 3D photogrammetry, chroma-keying, and how to apply these in an AR app.
