This interdisciplinary course addresses how principles of textual, visual, oral, and place-based storytelling challenge and enhance the conceptualisation, construction and experience of digitally-created worlds connecting to real-world places, locations, and landscapes. Applying principles of storytelling to digital worlds across multiple situations, platforms, and environments (built and natural) will help define and innovate the shape of these worlds. Focused on the underlying belief that technology and narrative create a feedback loop, with one mediating the other, this unit will be based on iterations of ideation, conceptualisation, and prototyping to integrate critical insights that will push on the boundaries of established beliefs and the regulated time-space we live by, in the connectedness of datafied space and localised place.
