This module looks at some of the key management issues that arise within research infrastructures with a clarity and urgency they don't often have below the infrastructural scale. It also looks at key trends and developments in these areas, and how exemplar projects are applying them. In particular, this module covers: User Engagement, Communications and Audiences, Sustainability, and the Macro-level issues, including managing the political environment.
