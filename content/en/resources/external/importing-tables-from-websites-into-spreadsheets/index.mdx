Sometimes in the course of humanities research it can be useful to take information, such as document lists from archives, from a website for future reference. If these items are in a table on a webpage, it is possible to capture these and import them into a spreadsheet for further analysis with the help of browser extensions.  This short resource will show the user how to download an extension to copy tables from websites (in this case, 'Table Capture' in the Google Chrome browser), and then import the table into a spreadsheet program.

Please note - any data taken from websites should always be given a proper citation.

## L﻿earning outcomes

A﻿fter viewing this training resource, users will be able to:

* Find and download a browser extension to suit their needs
* Quickly recreate a table from a website for further analysis
