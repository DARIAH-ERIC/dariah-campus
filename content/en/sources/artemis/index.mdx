ARTEMIS addresses is the Reactive Heritage Digital Twin (RHDT) which will enable heritage professionals to forecast the consequences of real-life events via sensors and other information collected automatically from other systems, or resulting from computer modelled experiments.

Most importantly, the digital twin technology will allow researchers and conservators to conduct virtual experiments and simulations, testing various conservation methods and their potential impact without risking damage to the actual heritage assets. This will lead to better, non-invasive interventions in conservation practices.
