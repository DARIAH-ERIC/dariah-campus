name: Digital Source Criticism
---
The combination of the three terms, ‘digital’, ‘source’ and ‘criticism’ refers to the need to apply a key principle for the professional historian - the critical assessment of the origin, authenticity and value of a historical source - to the digitised and digital born sources that are currently available on the web. This asks for a basic understanding of the transformation process from analog to digital, the creation process of digital born data, the publication of this information on the web, and the computational mechanisms to retrieve this information that are performed by search engines.
