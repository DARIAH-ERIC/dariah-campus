This collection of modules from the PARTHENOS project comprises the 'PARTHENOS Complete Guide to Research Infrastructures'. Each module meets the needs of users at different levels: An 'Introduction to Research Infrastructures' for Beginners; 'Management Challenges in Research Infrastructures' for Intermediate level; and 'Introduction to Collaborations in Research Infrastructures' for Advanced levels.

1. **Introduction to Research Infrastructures** provides a definition of what is and isn't a Research Infrastructure (RI), and introduces some of the main issues that are discussed within RIs, including metadata, data management, interoperability, sustainability, methods and tools, networks and research impact.
2. **Management Challenges in Research Infrastructures** looks at some of the key management issues that arise within RIs with a clarity and urgency they don’t often have below the infrastructural scale.  It also looks at key trends and developments in these areas, and how exemplar projects are applying them.  In particular, this module covers: User Engagement, Communications and Audiences, Sustainability, and the Macro-level issues, including managing the political environment.
3. **Introduction to Collaborations in Research Infrastructures** looks at how trans-disciplinary collaborations can be managed between RIs and project partners. In particular this module looks at collaborations between Humanities scholars and Computer Scientists, and the collaborations between RIs and Culture Heritage Institutions.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this curriculum, users should:

- **Understand** the elements of common definitions of research infrastructures
- **Understand** how research infrastructure supports methods and communities
- **Be aware of** some common critiques of digital research infrastructures in the Humanities.
- **Understand** issues around User Engagement, Communications and Audiences, Sustainability
- **Identify** and understand the Macro-level issues to managing RIs, including managing the political environment
- **Understand** what is meant by collaboration in humanities research
- **Be aware of** how this model of collaboration impacts upon the development of digital humanities, and digital humanities research infrastructures
